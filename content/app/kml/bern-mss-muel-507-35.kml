The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>26.25,39.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ephesus]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ephesus]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002499">Ephesus</a>"</h1>One of 12 ancient Ionian cities, located in fertile plain near the mouth of the Caÿster river; conquered by Persians; democracy granted by Alexander the Great; was center of cult of Diana; passed to Rome; an early Christian center, visited by St. Paul.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>27.3167,37.9167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Árgos]]></address><name><![CDATA[Árgos]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010720">Árgos</a>"</h1>Founded by Pelasgian people in 2nd millenium BCE. is one of nation's most ancient cities; Mycenaean center from 1300 BC; ruled by Dorians before 7th cen.

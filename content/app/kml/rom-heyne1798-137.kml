It was founded more than 2,000 years ago on an island in the Seine River. The City of Paris itself covers an area of 41 square miles (105 square kilometers). It occupies a central position in the productive agricultural region known as the Paris Basin. It is the nation's most important center of commerce and culture. It was captured and fortified by the Romans in 52 BCE and ruled by various other groups such as the Clovis, Northmen, English, and Germans.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.3333,48.8667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way. It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Hercul]]></address><name><![CDATA[Hercul]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7047982">Hercul</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Hessen]]></address><name><![CDATA[Hessen]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003678">Hessen</a>"</h1>The state of Hessen occupies 8,152 square miles in north-central Germany. Its territory forms the core of the medieval margraviate of Hessen, and extends west to east from the Rhine Plateau to the Thuringian Forest. The original landmargraviate of Hesse was founded from a portion of Thuringia. Its ruler, Henry I, came to hold the rank of prince in the Holy Roman Empire in 1292. Under Philip the Magnanimous, Hesse was twice partitioned and reunited, finally to be divided into four sections, one for each of his sons. In 1945 the modern state was created from the Hesse territories and part of Nassau. The capital is Wiesbaden and its largest city is Frankfurt am Main. The state is known for its educational institutions, and for the ruined castles and old churches along the Weser River, and the many half-timbered houses scattered throughout. The economy features agriculture on small or large scales, and a great deal of manufacturing, primarily in the south.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

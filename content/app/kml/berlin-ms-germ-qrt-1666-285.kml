By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.4167,51.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

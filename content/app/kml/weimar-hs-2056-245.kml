It rises in the west of Italy in the Cottian Alps, in the Monte Viso group. It empties into the Adriatic Sea. The river carries a very large sediment load, which expands the delta by around 200 acres per year. Ravenna and other ancient ports south of the delta are now miles from the sea as a result of silt from the Po carried down by currents in the Adriatic. The floods of the river and the silt load carried by it have long challenged hydraulic engineers; river regulation works originated in pre-Roman times, work was resumed in the Middle Ages, and the present arrangement existed by the end of the 15th century. Numerous projects have been undertaken in various areas of the river, including the Venetian Republic's having built dikes to control floods and canals to divert silt, and the Italian Land Reform's project to reclaim land in 1953.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.05,44.9667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Piemonte]]></address><name><![CDATA[Piemonte]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003120">Piemonte</a>"</h1>Part of the Roman Empire from 1st cen.

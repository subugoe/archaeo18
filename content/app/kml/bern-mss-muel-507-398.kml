Limoges flourished as an enamel artwork center in the 12th century; it is home to many artists of enamel painting. Limoges was destroyed in the 5th century, creating two separate towns in the 9th century; the two towns merged in 1792. Limoges was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela; French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Located in Limoges is a 13th-century Romanesque-Gothic cathedral, various churches, and Roman ruins.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>1.25,45.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

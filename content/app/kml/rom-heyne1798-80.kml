It lies astride the River Thames 50 miles (about 80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. It has burned and been rebuilt several times, notably in revolt of Queen Boudicca in 60 CE and in the Great Fire of 1666. It became a large trade center in the Middle Ages and expanded rapidly during the 16th and17th centuries and during the Industrial Revolution. During World War II the city was heavily bombed. London is not to be confused with Greater London which refers to all 32 London boroughs (Inner and Outer London boroughs) and the City of London; London is used to refer to the 12 Inner London boroughs and the City of London.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-.1667,51.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Portici]]></address><name><![CDATA[Portici]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006841">Portici</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14.3333,40.8167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way. It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

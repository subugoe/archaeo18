It thrived as a bishopric from the 5th century CE. It was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Historic sites in Aire-sur-l'Adour include the Cathedral of Saint Jean Baptistea and the Church of Sainte Quitterie du Mas d' Aire. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-.25,43.7</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Bodrum]]></address><name><![CDATA[Bodrum]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016142">Bodrum</a>"</h1>Located on Gökova Körfezi, opposite the Greek island of Kos; site of ancient city famed for the tomb of King Mausolus (351 BCE), one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world; modern town was developed by the Crusading Order of Hospitallers in 15th cen.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>27.4667,37.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Caria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Caria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002358">Caria</a>"</h1>Ancient region of Asia Minor, corresponding to the modern provinces of Aydin and Mugla in southwestern Turkey; passed from Lydia to Persia in 546 BCE; center of Ionian revolt 499 BCE; satrapy of Persian empire 377-353 BCE; conquered by Alexander the Great 334 BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>28,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Caria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Caria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002358">Caria</a>"</h1>Ancient region of Asia Minor, corresponding to the modern provinces of Aydin and Mugla in southwestern Turkey; passed from Lydia to Persia in 546 BCE; center of Ionian revolt 499 BCE; satrapy of Persian empire 377-353 BCE; conquered by Alexander the Great 334 BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>28,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.6333,43.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[España]]></address><name><![CDATA[España]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000095">España</a>"</h1>Area inhabited by Neanderthals 20,000 BCE, Homo Sapiens 13,000 BCE; growth of Almería culture 3000 BCE, El Argar 2000 BCE, and Tartessus 1000 BCE; colonized by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Visigoths; Muslim conquest in the 8th century; global expansion 15th-19th centurries; official language is Spanish, though Catalan, Galician, and Basque are also spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-4,40</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Nederland]]></address><name><![CDATA[Nederland]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016845">Nederland</a>"</h1>Area was inhabited by Celtic and Germanic tribes; Romans invaded 1st century BCE; Germanic tribes invaded 5th century; ruled by Frankish Merovingians and Charlemagne; part of medieval Lotharingia; province of Spanish Hapsburgs; colonized extensively in the 17th century; official language is Dutch.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>5.75,52.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Magyarország]]></address><name><![CDATA[Magyarország]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006278">Magyarország</a>"</h1>Agriculture developed by 4th mill.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Syrien]]></address><name><![CDATA[Syrien]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001407 6004687 7030348">Syrien</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Asia Minor]]></address><name><![CDATA[Asia Minor]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002294">Asia Minor</a>"</h1>Region and peninsula in the extreme western part of the continent of Asia, roughly coextensive with 3/5 of modern Turkey. It was for centuries a crossroads for eastern and western cultures. It was ruled by Hittites, Greeks, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines and Turks.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>35,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE). The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008331">Magna Graecia</a>"</h1>Refers to a group of ancient Greek seaport colonies along the coast of southern Italy, which grew as part of the Greek expansion of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pestum]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pestum]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7054730">Pestum</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

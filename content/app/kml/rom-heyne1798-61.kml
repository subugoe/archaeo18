The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Wien]]></address><name><![CDATA[Wien]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003321">Wien</a>"</h1>Located on the Danube River, at a crossroads in the center of Europe.

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church.

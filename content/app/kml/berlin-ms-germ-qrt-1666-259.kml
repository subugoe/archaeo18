Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.4167,52.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[London]]></address><name><![CDATA[London]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011781">London</a>"</h1>Longtime seat of the British Empire and capital of the United Kingdom.

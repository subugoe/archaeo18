According to the poet Ferdowsi, Hamadān was built by King Jamshid. It was taken by Cyrus II the Great of Persia 550 BCE and became a Median capital. Alexander the Great in 330 BCE later captured the city. Hamadān was again captured, first by the Arabs in 641 or 642 CE, and then later by the Mongols around 1220 CE. In 1386, Timur, the Turkish conqueror destroyed the city and massacred its people. In the 17th century, the city was partially restored, and frequently changed hands between the Iranians and the Ottomans. Today the city is known for its medallion schemed rugs. Historic sites in the region include the Stone Lion (Parthian Monument), Avicenna Memorial Tomb (built in 1954, manuscript library, Qajar tomb), Ganjnameh Epigraphes (Darius's inscriptions on Alvand Mountain in Abbasabad valley), and the Alavid Dome (Islamic monument from Saljuk period). <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>48.5833,34.7667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Babylon]]></address><name><![CDATA[Babylon]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002626">Babylon</a>"</h1>Was a thriving ancient center on the Euphrates river.

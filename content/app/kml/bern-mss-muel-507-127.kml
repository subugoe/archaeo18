Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.0667,49.45</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Velleia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Velleia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7023993">Velleia</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Piacenza]]></address><name><![CDATA[Piacenza]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004939">Piacenza</a>"</h1>Founded by the Romans in 218 BCE, it was destroyed by the Gauls 200 BC &amp; later rebuilt; became part of the Lombard League in the 12th cen.; under the control of the Visconti &amp; Sforza families from 1337 to 1512.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.6833,45.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Parma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Parma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004942">Parma</a>"</h1>Flourished as Roman center along Via Aemelia; was an early seat of bishop; destroyed by Ostrogoth king Theoderic; ruled by bishops from 9th cen.; torn by Guelph-Ghibelline strife 14th cen.; part of duchy of Parma &amp; Piacenza from 1545; damaged in WW II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.3167,44.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Parma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Parma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004942">Parma</a>"</h1>Flourished as Roman center along Via Aemelia; was an early seat of bishop; destroyed by Ostrogoth king Theoderic; ruled by bishops from 9th cen.; torn by Guelph-Ghibelline strife 14th cen.; part of duchy of Parma &amp; Piacenza from 1545; damaged in WW II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.3167,44.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Industria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Industria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7052777">Industria</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Torino]]></address><name><![CDATA[Torino]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7005688">Torino</a>"</h1>Located on Po river near junction with other rivers; Taurini town was partly destroyed by Hannibal 218 BCE; was important Roman military town; part of Lombard kingdom, then of Frankish empire; ruled by Savoy from the 11th century and held by the French in the 16th and 19th centuries.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>7.6667,45.0667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Po]]></address><name><![CDATA[Po]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010018">Po</a>"</h1>It is the longest river in Italy, over 405 miles long. It rises in the west of Italy in the Cottian Alps, in the Monte Viso group. It empties into the Adriatic Sea. The river carries a very large sediment load, which expands the delta by around 200 acres per year. Ravenna and other ancient ports south of the delta are now miles from the sea as a result of silt from the Po carried down by currents in the Adriatic. The floods of the river and the silt load carried by it have long challenged hydraulic engineers; river regulation works originated in pre-Roman times, work was resumed in the Middle Ages, and the present arrangement existed by the end of the 15th century. Numerous projects have been undertaken in various areas of the river, including the Venetian Republic's having built dikes to control floods and canals to divert silt, and the Italian Land Reform's project to reclaim land in 1953.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.05,44.9667</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

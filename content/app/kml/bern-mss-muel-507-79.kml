Only a few ruins of the city remain today on the Cadmea, the acropolis of ancient Thebes. It was named for Cadmus, the mythical founder of the city. Thebes was the main city of ancient Boeotia, and is identified with many legends, including stories of Dirce, Epigonus, Oedipus and the Sphinx. It entered a power struggle with Athens in the 6th cen. BCE. It was destroyed by Alexander the Great.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>23.3167,38.3167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Perugia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Perugia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000526">Perugia</a>"</h1>Ancient hill town; was home to Umbrians, and one of 12 cities of ancient Etruria; passed to Rome in 310 BCE, to Lombards in 592 CE; generally Guelph in Guelph/Ghibelline wars with neighboring towns; torn by internal strife in the 15th century; came under control of papacy in 1540.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.3667,43.1333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770.

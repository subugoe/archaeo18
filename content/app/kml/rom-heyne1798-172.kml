It lies astride the River Thames 50 miles (about 80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. It has burned and been rebuilt several times, notably in revolt of Queen Boudicca in 60 CE and in the Great Fire of 1666. It became a large trade center in the Middle Ages and expanded rapidly during the 16th and17th centuries and during the Industrial Revolution. During World War II the city was heavily bombed. London is not to be confused with Greater London which refers to all 32 London boroughs (Inner and Outer London boroughs) and the City of London; London is used to refer to the 12 Inner London boroughs and the City of London.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-.1667,51.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Phrygia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Phrygia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002613">Phrygia</a>"</h1>Ancient country in W central Asia Minor, now central Turkey; kingdom flourished 8th-6th cen.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

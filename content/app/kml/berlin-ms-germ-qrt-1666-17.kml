It was the site of Bronze Age and Roman settlements, was destroyed by the Alemanni in the 5th century, then rebuilt by the Franks. It was a leading medieval commercial and banking center; and was an important site in the development of Lutheranism in the 16th century. It declined in power during the Thirty Years War and passed to Bavaria in 1806. The artists Hans Holbein, the Elder and the Younger, and Hans Burgkmair were born in the town. Augsburg is the administrative capital of the Bavarian district of Swabia. It was the site of a firestorm caused by bombardment in World War II and was severely damaged, but much of its historic architecture survived to be restored. The city is rich in Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque buildings and fountains. It has a university founded in 1970, three colleges of music, and a technical college. In 1974, Augsburg annexed two neighboring cities, GÃ¶ggingen and Haunstetten. It has grown to be a major site for heavy industry, chemicals, metal, and electrical plants. The 2004 estimated population was 260,600.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.9,48.35</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Volterra]]></address><name><![CDATA[Volterra]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006305">Volterra</a>"</h1>Located northwest of Siena, Tuscany.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Leipzig]]></address><name><![CDATA[Leipzig]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7012329">Leipzig</a>"</h1>The eastern German city of Leipzig is situated at the junction of the Pleisse, Parthe, and Weisse Elster rivers, some 113 miles southwest of Berlin. By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.4167,51.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></address><name><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000084">Deutschland</a>"</h1>The area of north-central Europe occupied by what is now modern Germany measures some 137,828 square miles in size. Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North. The 2004 estimated population was 82,633,200.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.5,51.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

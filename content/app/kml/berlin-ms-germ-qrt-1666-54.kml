It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></address><name><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000084">Deutschland</a>"</h1>The area of north-central Europe occupied by what is now modern Germany measures some 137,828 square miles in size. Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North. The 2004 estimated population was 82,633,200.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.5,51.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Potsdam]]></address><name><![CDATA[Potsdam]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004463">Potsdam</a>"</h1>The city of Potsdam is located where the Nuthe River flows into the Havel, in the district of Potsdam in the eastern German state of Brandenburg.

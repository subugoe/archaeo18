The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

The region is composed of four broad belts of land stretching from north to south: in the west the high Pennine moorlands dissected by the Yorkshire Dales; in the southeast the central lowlands (including the Vale of York) draining into the River Humber estuary; in the east the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds; and, farther southeast, the Holderness plain along the North Sea. Yorkshire was bordered by the historic counties of Durham to the north, Westmorland to the northwest, Lancashire to the west, Cheshire and Derbyshire to the southwest, and Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the southeast. Yorkshire is now composed of all or most of the following administrative units: the county of North Yorkshire; the unitary authorities of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull, and York; the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees south of the River Tees; and all or most of every metropolitan borough in the metropolitan counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The exceptions are the parish of Finningley and the area west of Bawtry (both in the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire) which lie within the historic county of Nottinghamshire; the area around Beighton and Mosborough in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, which belongs to the historic county of Derbyshire; and the area west of Todmorden in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which lies within the historic county of Lancashire. The historic county also includes three large areas in other administrative units: much of the eastern part of the administrative county of Lancashire and much of the borough of Ribble Valley, including the entire Forest of Bowland region; Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh in the South Lakeland district of the administrative county of Cumbria; the area south of the Tees in the Teesdale district of the administrative county of Durham; and small areas along the southeast border of the historic county of Yorkshire lie in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. Yorkshire has a rich history: there are many prehistoric remains, including the impressive earthworks at Stanwick, and it was a Roman military stronghold from the 1st to the 5th century CE. After a time being controlled by indigenous Britons, Yorkshire became part of the kingdom of Deira from the 6th to the 9th century. It was taken by Danes 875 and recaptured by kings of Wessex 954. The region remained strongly Anglo-Scandinavian in culture until the Normans took control in 1069. Important monasteries were founded here and large artistocratic estates were established. After the Black Death of the 14th century, most of Yorkshire's crop land became pasture for sheep and woolen manufacture became an important industry. It was the base for Yorkists during War of the Roses (1455-1485) and two of the most important battles were fought here (Wakefield and Towton, 1460 and 1461). The battle at Marston Moor in 1644 was one of the most crucial of the English Civil Wars. Yorkshire's long history has left behind an outstanding array of architecture: pre-Norman churches; impressive ruined abbeys such as Rievaulx; castles such as Bolton; the outstanding Gothic York Minster; and notable country houses such as 18th-century Castle Howard.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Hannover]]></address><name><![CDATA[Hannover]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7013260">Hannover</a>"</h1>The city of Hanover, capitol of Lower Saxony, Germany, is situated on the Leine River and the Mittelland Canal. It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-LÃ¶ns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.7333,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[England]]></address><name><![CDATA[England]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002445">England</a>"</h1>Area had Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Age cultures; controlled by Rome late 1st century CE; invaded by Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, who formed kingdoms by the 5th century and from whose Germanic languages English was primarily derived; Vikings invaded in 1016 and the Normans in 1066.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-2,53</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Perugia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Perugia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000526">Perugia</a>"</h1>Ancient hill town; was home to Umbrians, and one of 12 cities of ancient Etruria; passed to Rome in 310 BCE, to Lombards in 592 CE; generally Guelph in Guelph/Ghibelline wars with neighboring towns; torn by internal strife in the 15th century; came under control of papacy in 1540.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.3667,43.1333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

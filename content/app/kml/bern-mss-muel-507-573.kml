It is roughly coextensive with the former province of Provence and with the present-day region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. It was an important region for the Roman Empire; when the Roman Empire declined, the region was invaded by Visigoths, Burgundians, Ostrogoths, and  Franks. It was part of Lothar I's realm in 843; it passed to Charles of Anjou as dowry in 1246; ruled by Angevins until 1481; ruled by Louis XI 1481. Invaded repeatedly 1524, 1536, 1704, and 1746 by rival French royalty.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way. It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[France]]></address><name><![CDATA[France]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000070">France</a>"</h1>Area inhabited by Lower Paleolithic; Celt-speaking Gauls dominated by 5th century BCE; part of Roman Empire 125 BCE-5th century, then under Frankish influence; lost land to England 12th-16th centuries; monarchy fell in Revolution 1792; recurring expansion 16-19th centuries; official language is French, though Provençal, Breton, Flemish, Catalan, Corsican, Basque, and Germanic regional patois are also spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2,46</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></address><name><![CDATA[Deutschland]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000084">Deutschland</a>"</h1>The area of north-central Europe occupied by what is now modern Germany measures some 137,828 square miles in size. Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

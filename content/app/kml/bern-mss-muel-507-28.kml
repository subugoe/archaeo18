After playing an important role during the Seleucid (312-175 BCE), Parthian (247 BCE- 224 CE), and Sāsānid (224-651 CE) dynasties, Arabs took over the region and established a military base at Shīrāz, which then became a flourishing regional center. Further Arab dynasties built palaces, gardens, mosques and fortified the city walls. Timur (Tamerlane), the Turkic conqueror, ruled the city in the late 14th century. Shīrāz later became the capital of the Zand dynasty (1750-1794). The region is known for its wine.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>52.5667,29.6333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

Although archeological findings indicate prehistoric settlements, inscriptions claim the city was built during the reign of Darius I (reg 522-486 BCE), who replaced Pasargadae with Persepolis as the capital. The city and castle of Xerxes I, Darius's son, (reg 485-465 BCE), was destroyed by Alexander the Great. In 316 BCE, Persepolis became the capital of Persis, a Macedonian empire, and then began to decline during the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE). By the 3rd century CE, the neaby city of Istakhr became the center of the Sasanian empire. Investigation of Persepolis' ruins began in 1618 by García Silva Figueroa, a Spanish ambassador to Persia who found references of the ancient city in the works by Quintus Curtius, Diodorus and Plutarch. In 1626, Englishman Thomas Herbert, published the first engraving of the ruins. Archaeological excavations at the site commenced in 1931 under Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt of the University of Chicago from 1931-1939, and through 1979 by Îrānian archaeologists.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>52.8833,29.9333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

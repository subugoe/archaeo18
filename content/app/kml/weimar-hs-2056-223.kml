It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Potsdam]]></address><name><![CDATA[Potsdam]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004463">Potsdam</a>"</h1>The city of Potsdam is located where the Nuthe River flows into the Havel, in the district of Potsdam in the eastern German state of Brandenburg. Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770. The modern city boasts educational and scientific institutions, and healthy industries in bootbuilding, food processing, locomotive building, and textiles. The 2004 estimated population was 131,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.0667,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.0667,49.45</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Schwaben]]></address><name><![CDATA[Schwaben]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7012729">Schwaben</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.5,47.9167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Danmark]]></address><name><![CDATA[Danmark]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000066">Danmark</a>"</h1>The nation of Denmark occupies the Jutland Peninsula, extending northwards from the center of western Europe, and some 400 islands to the east of it. It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10,56</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Rossiya]]></address><name><![CDATA[Rossiya]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002435">Rossiya</a>"</h1>Area was inhabited by many early cultures including Scythians (7th century BCE), Sarmatians, Goths (3rd century CE), Huns, Avars, Khazars, Bulgars, and Slavs; Varangians (Scandinavians) created Russian state in the 9th century; was core of large empire and Soviet Union (1922); official language is Russian.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>47,60</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Milano]]></address><name><![CDATA[Milano]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7005903">Milano</a>"</h1>One of nation's richest cities; became the second city of the western Roman Empire after Rome; sacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and by Goths in 539; battled for autonomy with nearby cities 11th-12th centuries; controlled by Sforza family 15th century and by Spain 1540-1706; won independence from Austria in 1848; heavily bombed during World War II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.2,45.4667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Danmark]]></address><name><![CDATA[Danmark]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000066">Danmark</a>"</h1>The nation of Denmark occupies the Jutland Peninsula, extending northwards from the center of western Europe, and some 400 islands to the east of it.

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Napoli]]></address><name><![CDATA[Napoli]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004474">Napoli</a>"</h1>Founded on site of Parthenope by refugees from Cumae; conquered by Romans 4th cen.

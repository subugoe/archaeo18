It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-LÃ¶ns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.7333,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Quirinale]]></address><name><![CDATA[Quirinale]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=4012799">Quirinale</a>"</h1>One of the 7 hills of Rome, site of the former royal (now presidential) Palazzo del Quirinale.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Etruria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Etruria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7024113">Etruria</a>"</h1>Includes area of Etruscan culture in central Italy, particularly confederation of 12 city states; Etruscans possibly arrived from Asia Minor in 9th century BCE, or were of local origins; modern scholars believe they include early Villanovan culture; economy was based on agriculture, mining iron and copper, and harvesting forests; was noted as fierce maritime power; flourished in the 7th-3rd centuries BCE, culture had been absorbed by Roman culture by 1st century BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11,43.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

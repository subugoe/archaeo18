Phoenicia was an important ancient country in ancient Syria, comprising several city-states by 1600 BCE. The Phoenicians were of Semitic origin (a branch of the Canaanites) and were famed as maritime traders. In 538 Phoenicia came under the rule of the Persians and it was later taken by Alexander the Great. The Roman Empire assumed direct rule in 64 BCE and Phoenicia was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria, though Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre retained self-government. The chief cities of Phoenicia (excluding colonies) were Sidon, Tyre, and Berot (modern Beirut).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Phoenicia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Phoenicia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=6004687">Phoenicia</a>"</h1>Ancient region in Asia along the Mediterranean, corresponding to modern Lebanon, with adjoining parts of modern Syria and Israel.

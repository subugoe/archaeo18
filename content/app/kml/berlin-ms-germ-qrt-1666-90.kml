Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment.

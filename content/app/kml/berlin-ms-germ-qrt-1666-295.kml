Originally a Celtic settlement, a Roman military camp was founded here by the Roman general Drusus 14-9 BCE. It became self-governing from 1118 to 1462, when a rebellion caused it to lose its free city privileges, and the leader of the league of Rhenish towns from 1254. It was a French possession from 1797 to 1815, and occupied by the French army from 1918 to 1930. It was almost totally destroyed in World War II, but has been rebuilt. Surviving historic architecture includes an 11th-century Romanesque cathedral, a 17th-century elector's palace, and a 19th-century German fortress built on the site of the old Roman military post. Mainz had a university from 1477 to 1816, but a new one, the Johannes Gutenberg University, it in 1946, honoring its native son who invented movable type here. The city is an educational center, with the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, the Institute for Economic Research, and the Academy of Sciences and Literature. There are many museums of art, history, and natural history, the Gutenberg Museum among them. The city's economic activities include the wine trade for the Rhineland, the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, machinery, glassware, and musical instruments. It is known for its wine and pre-Lenten festivals. The 2005 population was calculated at 187,940.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>8.2667,50</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Köln]]></address><name><![CDATA[Köln]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004446">Köln</a>"</h1>The western German city of Cologne is situated on the west bank of the Rhine. The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>6.95,50.9333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Luxembourg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Luxembourg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003514">Luxembourg</a>"</h1>Inhabited by Belgic Treveri tribe when Romans invaded 57 BC; Germanic tribes invaded ca. 400; part of Frankish kingdom of Austrasia, &amp; of Carolingian empire; ruled by counts of Luxembourg 11th cen., by Burgundy 1440s; was part of Spanish Netherlands; languages are French (used for civil service, law &amp; parliament) &amp; German (used by the press), &amp; spoken tongue is the Letzeburgish dialect (of Moselle Frankish origin).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>6.1667,49.75</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Venezia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Venezia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7018159">Venezia</a>"</h1>The islands of the Venetian lagoon were settled by refugees from Altino and Aquileia after the Lombard invasion of northern Italy in 568.

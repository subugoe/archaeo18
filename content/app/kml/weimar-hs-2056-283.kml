Under the name Apollonia it became an important center for the trade in northern European products such as amber, salt, and iron. It was the site of a celebrated Sanctuary of Apollo, and then the seat of a bishop during Byzantine Empire. The modern seaport handles fish from the Black Sea and enjoys a burgeoning tourist industry.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>27.7,42.3833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pontos]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pontos]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7029624">Pontos</a>"</h1>The historic region of Pontos roughly encompassed most of the eastern Black Sea coast of northeastern Asia Minor, stretching on the coast from just west of Ayancık to just east of Hopa (most of this area is in modern Turkey). Greeks have been active in the area for a long time, with evidence of trading journeys taking place in the area around 1000 BCE. In the 8th century BCE, trading posts began to develop into permanent and increasingly prosperous settlements. The region briefly resisted Rome's hegemony in Asia Minor in the 1st century BCE. An independent Pontic kingdom with its capital at Amaseia (modern Amasya) was established at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. While superficially Hellenized, the kingdom retained its Persian social structure, with temple priests and feudal nobles ruling over a heterogeneous population. Pontus gradually asserted itself among the petty Hellenistic states of Asia Minor in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, annexing Sinope (modern Sinop) as its new capital (183 BCE). The Pontic kingdom reached its zenith under Mithradates VI Eupator (ca. 115-163 BCE), whose expansion programs brought about disastrous conflict with Rome, resulting in the incorporation of the kingdom into the Roman Empire (63-62 BCE). After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and of Trebizond (1461), many Pontian Greeks fled to Russia where they founded new villages and cities. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne brought about the expulsion of Christian Greeks living on Turkish territory. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Greeks living in Pontus in 1914, 300,000 were killed and the remainder became refugees. Despite this so-called "Catastrophe of Asia Minor," there are currently about 300,000 Muslim Grecophone Pontians on Turkey's Black Sea coast. Many Greek myths have connections to this region, including the trip of Jason and the Argonauts to find the Golden Fleece; the adventures of Ulysses in the land of the Cimmerians; and the sailing of Hercules on the Black Sea.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Italia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Italia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000080">Italia</a>"</h1>Inhabited since 50,000 BCE; settled by Indo-Europeans 1850 BCE, Etruscans 1600 BCE, and Greeks 800 BCE; united by Romans 270 BCE; independent states rose after fall of Holy Roman Empire, notably Naples, Milan, Florence, Venice and papacy; reunited in the 19th century; official language is Italian, though significant minorities speak German, French, and Slovene.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.8333,42.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Taranto]]></address><name><![CDATA[Taranto]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004100">Taranto</a>"</h1>Comprises old city on island &amp; newer section on mainland; reached height of military power 4th cen.

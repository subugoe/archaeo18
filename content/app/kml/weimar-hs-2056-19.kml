The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008331">Magna Graecia</a>"</h1>Refers to a group of ancient Greek seaport colonies along the coast of southern Italy, which grew as part of the Greek expansion of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Salamís]]></address><name><![CDATA[Salamís]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011052">Salamís</a>"</h1>Located in the Saronic Gulf; noted as site of naval battle with Persians in 480 BC, &amp; later was haven for Athenian refugees; a Greek naval base is now located on the island.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Plataea]]></address><name><![CDATA[Plataea]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011028">Plataea</a>"</h1>Located in E central Greece, S of Thebes; was a thriving ancient city allied with Athens during Persian Wars in 500 BC; was destroyed several times in Antiquity, by Persians, Greeks, Thebes, &amp; Alexander the Great.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Athínai]]></address><name><![CDATA[Athínai]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001393">Athínai</a>"</h1>Was an ancient metropolis of great importance; settled in Neolithic times.

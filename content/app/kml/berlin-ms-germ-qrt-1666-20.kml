It is first mentioned under the name Guting in 953. Receiving its charter in 1211, it became a powerful member of the Hanseatic League in the 14th century. It sustained severe damage during the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, but revived with the founding of the University of Göttingen, which soon became known of one of the best in Europe. The dismissal of seven professors (including J and K Grimm) in 1837 caused a sharp decline in its academic reputation and hence the prosperity of the city. Strong math and physics faculties eventually restored its good name in the late 19th century. The university's library has one of the finest collections in Europe and draws many visitors. Largely undamaged during World War II, the city retains much of its historic architecture, including whole streets of medieval half-timbered buildings, the city ramparts, and several Gothic churches. Its industries include tourism, the production of optical and precision instruments and printing. Its 2004 estimated population was 123,100.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.95,51.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

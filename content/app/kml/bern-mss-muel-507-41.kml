The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sybaris]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sybaris]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004265">Sybaris</a>"</h1>Located near Terranova di Sibari; oldest city of Magna Graecia, noted for its luxury (hence English word 'sybaritic'); founded ca. 720 BC by Achaeans &amp; Troezenians; was defeated in war with Crotone &amp; utterly destroyed in 510 BC.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Crotone]]></address><name><![CDATA[Crotone]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004291">Crotone</a>"</h1>Located on Gulf of Taranto; founded by Achaean Greeks; was powerful &amp; rich, famous for Olympic athletes from 588 BC; established democracy; defeated by the Bruttii, Syracuse &amp; Epirus; Roman from 3rd cen.

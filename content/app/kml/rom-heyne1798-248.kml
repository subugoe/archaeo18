The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Gallia Cisalpina]]></address><name><![CDATA[Gallia Cisalpina]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=6002195">Gallia Cisalpina</a>"</h1>Roman province in the area of northern Italy between the Apennines and the Alps. It was settled by Celtic tribes. Rome conquered the Celts between 224 and 220 BCE, extending its northeastern frontier to the Julian Alps. When Hannibal invaded Italy in 218 BCE, the Celts joined his forces, and Rome lost this territory. It was recovered, however, between 198 and 191 BCE. It was incorporated into Italy in 42 BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Campania]]></address><name><![CDATA[Campania]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003005">Campania</a>"</h1>Productive agricultural area from ancient times; settled by Etruscans; taken by Samnites 5th century BCE, supported Greek colonies along coast; was Roman from 4th century BCE; later ruled by Goths, Byzantines, Lombards, and Normans; part of Two Sicilies from 1282.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14.8333,40.9167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Etruria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Etruria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7024113">Etruria</a>"</h1>Includes area of Etruscan culture in central Italy, particularly confederation of 12 city states; Etruscans possibly arrived from Asia Minor in 9th century BCE, or were of local origins; modern scholars believe they include early Villanovan culture; economy was based on agriculture, mining iron and copper, and harvesting forests; was noted as fierce maritime power; flourished in the 7th-3rd centuries BCE, culture had been absorbed by Roman culture by 1st century BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11,43.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Chiusi]]></address><name><![CDATA[Chiusi]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006344">Chiusi</a>"</h1>Was one of the 12 original cities of Etruria; flourished 7th-6th centuries BCE; noted as site from which Lars Porsena marched against Rome ca. 500 BCE; was subject to Rome from 295 BCE; declined in Middle Ages due to proximity to swamps of Chiani river.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.95,43.0333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Tarquinia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Tarquinia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006776">Tarquinia</a>"</h1>Legendary founder was Tarchon (Strabo: Geography V); reputedly the oldest Etruscan city in Italy; noted as earliest settlement in Etruria of the Villanovans; came under Rome probably by late 4th century BCE; gained Roman citizenship in 90 BCE; ancient site was abandoned in 8th or 9th century CE, when modern Corneto (since 1922 known as Tarquinia too) was founded nearby.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.7667,42.25</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East. With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

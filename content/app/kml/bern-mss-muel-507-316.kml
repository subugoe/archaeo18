It flourished under the Lombard kings (6th century CE) and was a Medieval self-governing commune (constitution dates to 1179). Siena was a Medieval seat of pro-imperial Ghibelline power and was an economic and territorial rival of Guelf (anti-imperial) Florence. The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.3167,43.3167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Iliá]]></address><name><![CDATA[Iliá]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=5001986">Iliá</a>"</h1>Large ancient city located between modern villages of Paliopolis, Bouchioti &amp; Kalyvia; Early Helladic settlement grew up around acropolis; was hub of powerful ancient state of Elis after Dorian invasions; declined in scale in Late Roman period.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark></Document></kml>

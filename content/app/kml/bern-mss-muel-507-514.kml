The town grew around a castle that became the Guelph (Welf) dukes' residence in the 13th century. It was captured by the Protestant Schmalkaldic League in 1542; went to Braunschweig in 1753. The old town contains the castle residence of the dukes of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel and the Church of St, Mary, built 1604-23. There are also many Renaissance and Baroque half-timbered houses. The ducal Herzog-August Library contains a large collection of medieval manuscripts. The ducal librarians have included such notable people as the philosopher Leibnitz and the playwright Gotthold Lessing. The modern city's industries include canning, the production of chemical and musical equipment, and agricultural machinery. The 2004 estimated population was 54,800. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.55,52.1667</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

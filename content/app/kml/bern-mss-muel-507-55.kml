It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East.

Phoenicia was an important ancient country in ancient Syria, comprising several city-states by 1600 BCE. The Phoenicians were of Semitic origin (a branch of the Canaanites) and were famed as maritime traders. In 538 Phoenicia came under the rule of the Persians and it was later taken by Alexander the Great. The Roman Empire assumed direct rule in 64 BCE and Phoenicia was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria, though Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre retained self-government. The chief cities of Phoenicia (excluding colonies) were Sidon, Tyre, and Berot (modern Beirut).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Asia Minor]]></address><name><![CDATA[Asia Minor]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002294">Asia Minor</a>"</h1>Region and peninsula in the extreme western part of the continent of Asia, roughly coextensive with 3/5 of modern Turkey.

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-LÃ¶ns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.7333,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Frascati]]></address><name><![CDATA[Frascati]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7007013">Frascati</a>"</h1>Located in Alban hills; town grew up around a villa; inhabitants of nearby Tusculum fled here when their city was destroyed in 1191; was papal possession in Middle Ages; has long been a favorite summer residence for Roman nobility; badly damaged in WW II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.6833,41.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

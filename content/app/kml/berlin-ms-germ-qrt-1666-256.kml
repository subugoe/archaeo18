Orléans was conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BCE; many Roman ruins have been found here. It was the most important city in France after Paris during the 10th and 11th centuries and it was the center of the royal duchy established by Philip VI in 1344. Orléans was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. The symbol of Saint James, the scalloped shell, became the primary symbol representing pilgrims. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Orléans is known as the city that was saved by the heroine Joan of Arc. An equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in the center of town and the large Gothic-style Cathedral of Sainte-Croix are historic landmarks.  Modern Orléans is a center for gardening and horticulture; it is particularly known for its roses. Other industries in Orléans include textiles, food processing, machinery manufacturing, and electrical engineering.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>1.9,47.9</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Lyon]]></address><name><![CDATA[Lyon]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008772">Lyon</a>"</h1>Residence of Roman emperors; sacked by Huns and Visigoths; taken by Saracens in the 8th century; incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032; united to the French crown in 1312; prospered in the 16th century but declined during the wars of religion; scene of revolts in the 19th century.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.8333,45.7667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Paris]]></address><name><![CDATA[Paris]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008038">Paris</a>"</h1>Paris is the city and capital of France, located in the north-central part of the country.

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>26.25,39.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Athínai]]></address><name><![CDATA[Athínai]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001393">Athínai</a>"</h1>Was an ancient metropolis of great importance; settled in Neolithic times.

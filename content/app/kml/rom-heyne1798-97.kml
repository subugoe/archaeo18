It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Versailles]]></address><name><![CDATA[Versailles]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008070">Versailles</a>"</h1>Built by French kings on site of Louis XIII's hunting lodge; seat of court of Louis XIV who built large palace; meeting place of States-General in 1783; scene of several treaty signings; German headquarters 1870-1871; seat of French government 1871-1879.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.1333,48.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

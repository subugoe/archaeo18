French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.6333,43.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

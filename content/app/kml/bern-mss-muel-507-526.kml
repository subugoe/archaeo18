It grew and developed in the 12th century under Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, and won its charter in 1247. It became a member of the Hanseatic League, passed into the possession of Hanover in 1705, then to Prussia in 1866. It suffered very little damage in World War II, and so much of its historic architecture survives. Among its structures are several brick buildings in northern German Gothic style, an entire square of Gothic and Renaissance houses called the Sand, the ducal palace, 1693-96, the town hall, 13th to 18th century, and the churches of St. Nicholas and St. John of the 13th and 14th centuries. Modern industries include wood products, the manufacture of chemicals and foodstuffs, and the mining of salt, metal, and coal. Having salt springs, it is also a spa and health resort. The 2004 estimated population was 69,000.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.4,53.25</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way. It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

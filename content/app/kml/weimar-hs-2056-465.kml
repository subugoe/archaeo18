Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Tuscolo]]></address><name><![CDATA[Tuscolo]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008406">Tuscolo</a>"</h1>Was an early rival of Rome, by which it was made subject after the battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC; was home of Cicero.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.7,41.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[İstanbul]]></address><name><![CDATA[İstanbul]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002473">İstanbul</a>"</h1>Held by Persian Empire 512 BCE; Roman Republic free city; seat of Constantine I's empire from 330; declared a Christian city by Constantine; attacked by Persians, Arabs, Bulgars and Russians during the 6th-13th centuries; taken by Fourth Crusade army in 1203; taken by Ottomans.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>28.95,41.0333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Europe]]></address><name><![CDATA[Europe]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000003">Europe</a>"</h1>Europe was an early home to Homo erectus, Neanderthal and modern Homo sapiens. Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark></Document></kml>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.4167,52.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Charlottenburg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Charlottenburg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1004256">Charlottenburg</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.2667,52.5167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Hannover]]></address><name><![CDATA[Hannover]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7013260">Hannover</a>"</h1>The city of Hanover, capitol of Lower Saxony, Germany, is situated on the Leine River and the Mittelland Canal. It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.7333,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

Capital of the Celtic tribe Allobroges and rival of Lyon in ancient times. Conquered by the Romans in 121 BCE, it became an important town of Roman Gaul. Late in the 9th century the town became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Vienne was the site of council held to suppress Knights Templars 1311-1312.  The town was transferred to French sovereignty in 1450. Roman remains including a temple of Augustus and Livia, a theater, and an obelisk can still be seen; there is also a museum of Roman antiquities. There are three important medieval churches here, the largest being Saint-Maurice Cathedral, built in the 12th-15th centuries. Present-day Vienne is a marketing center for the agricultural produce of the Rhône River valley. Its industries include textiles, metallurgy, and footwear. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.9,45.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Catania]]></address><name><![CDATA[Catania]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003947">Catania</a>"</h1>Located at foot of Mount Etna; founded by Greeks in 8th cen.

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

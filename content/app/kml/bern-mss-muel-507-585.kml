It was founded more than 2,000 years ago on an island in the Seine River. The City of Paris itself covers an area of 41 square miles (105 square kilometers). It occupies a central position in the productive agricultural region known as the Paris Basin. It is the nation's most important center of commerce and culture. It was captured and fortified by the Romans in 52 BCE and ruled by various other groups such as the Clovis, Northmen, English, and Germans.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.3333,48.8667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Europe]]></address><name><![CDATA[Europe]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000003">Europe</a>"</h1>Europe was an early home to Homo erectus, Neanderthal and modern Homo sapiens. Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark></Document></kml>

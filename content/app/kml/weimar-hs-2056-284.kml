The modern department (area 1,404 square miles) corresponds closely to the ancient province, which was bounded by Arcadia and Argolis on the north and Messenia in the west. Sparta, capital of the modern department, was also the capital of the ancient province.The coast, especially in the east, is rugged, with few good harbors. Mount Ilías (7,887 feet), the highest mountain of the Peloponnese, is here. Laconia remains more hospitable to grazing than agriculture. Neolithic sites (pre-2500 BCE) are found in the Evrótas valley, the Maléa peninsula, and elsewhere. Many settlements were founded in the Late Mycenaean period (1400-1100 BCE). According to Homer, Laconia was a strong kingdom ruled by Menelaus. The Dorian Invasion (ca. 1100 BCE) brought widespread destruction to the area. Coastal towns were freed by Rome in 195 BCE and they became members of the Achaean League, which eventually included all of Laconia. In 267 CE and again in 395 CE, Visigoths devastated the area, and there were Slavic incursions about 587 that led to two centuries of barbarism. Laconia became part of the Byzantine Empire in 805, and it was the site of struggles  between Slavs, Byzantines, Franks, Turks, and Venetians throughout the Middle Ages. Tradition holds that the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine Palaeologus, was crowned in the church of Hagios Demetrios, which still stands at Mistrás, southwest of Sparta. Inhabitants of the Máni peninsula played a prominent role in the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829). Archaeological work has been conducted in Sparta, Gythium, and Vapheio and a systematic survey of Laconia was begun in 1904 by the British School of Athens and continued intermittently. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22.5833,37</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pelopónnisos]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pelopónnisos]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7017076">Pelopónnisos</a>"</h1>Area forming S part of mainland Greece; originally inhabited by Leges &amp; Pelasgians, who may have built Mycenae and Tiryns; Achaeans arrived 14th cen.

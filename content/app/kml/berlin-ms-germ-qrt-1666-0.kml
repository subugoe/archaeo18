Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North. The 2004 estimated population was 82,633,200.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.5,51.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Berlin]]></address><name><![CDATA[Berlin]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003712">Berlin</a>"</h1>The city of Berlin in the state of Berlin lies on both sides of the Spree River in its wide glacial valley in the center of unified Germany. Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.4167,52.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Göttingen]]></address><name><![CDATA[Göttingen]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7005246">Göttingen</a>"</h1>The city of Göttingen is located on the Leine River in Lower Saxony in north-central Germany.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

It was the site of Bronze Age and Roman settlements, was destroyed by the Alemanni in the 5th century, then rebuilt by the Franks. It was a leading medieval commercial and banking center; and was an important site in the development of Lutheranism in the 16th century. It declined in power during the Thirty Years War and passed to Bavaria in 1806. The artists Hans Holbein, the Elder and the Younger, and Hans Burgkmair were born in the town. Augsburg is the administrative capital of the Bavarian district of Swabia. It was the site of a firestorm caused by bombardment in World War II and was severely damaged, but much of its historic architecture survived to be restored. The city is rich in Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque buildings and fountains. It has a university founded in 1970, three colleges of music, and a technical college. In 1974, Augsburg annexed two neighboring cities, Göggingen and Haunstetten. It has grown to be a major site for heavy industry, chemicals, metal, and electrical plants.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Versailles, Château de]]></address><name><![CDATA[Versailles, Château de]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1100363">Versailles, Château de</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.1167,48.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Bithynia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Bithynia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016608">Bithynia</a>"</h1>Ancient region of western Asia Minor, bordering the Black Sea; dominated by Persia after the 6th century BCE; ruled by Hellenistic kingship 2nd century BCE; reached apex of its power under Eumenes II (197-160 BCE); became a Roman province in 74 BCE; was split under Byzantines.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>30.25,40.1667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Nīl, Nahr an-]]></address><name><![CDATA[Nīl, Nahr an-]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1127805">Nīl, Nahr an-</a>"</h1>Longest river in the world, rising south of the equator and flowing through northeastern Africa, draining in the Mediterranean; formed principally by the White Nile, Blue Nile, and Atbara rivers; year-long water supply allowed great civilizations to grow up along its banks.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>31.1,30.1667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Edirne]]></address><name><![CDATA[Edirne]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002317">Edirne</a>"</h1>Attacked by Avars 586; taken by Bulgars in the 10th century; twice besieged by Crusaders; taken by Ottomans in 1362; subsequently used as stronghold for Ottoman expansion into European continent; under Russian occupation in 1829 and 1878.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>26.5667,41.6667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Esquilino]]></address><name><![CDATA[Esquilino]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=4012794">Esquilino</a>"</h1>One of the 7 hills of Rome.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Hannover]]></address><name><![CDATA[Hannover]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7013260">Hannover</a>"</h1>The city of Hanover, capitol of Lower Saxony, Germany, is situated on the Leine River and the Mittelland Canal.

Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Phrygia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Phrygia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002613">Phrygia</a>"</h1>Ancient country in W central Asia Minor, now central Turkey; kingdom flourished 8th-6th cen.

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.7333,52.4</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Mayland]]></address><name><![CDATA[Mayland]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1030011">Mayland</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>.7833,51.65</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Castellazo]]></address><name><![CDATA[Castellazo]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7342304">Castellazo</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Akri]]></address><name><![CDATA[Akri]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010713">Akri</a>"</h1>Located at mouth of Ambracian gulf; was famous for temple of Apollo &amp; biennial games; noted as site of Roman naval battle where Octavian defeated Mark Antony &amp; forces of Cleopatra in 31 BC; the games were then moved to Augustus' new city of Nikopolis.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Venezia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Venezia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7018159">Venezia</a>"</h1>The islands of the Venetian lagoon were settled by refugees from Altino and Aquileia after the Lombard invasion of northern Italy in 568.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[England]]></address><name><![CDATA[England]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002445">England</a>"</h1>Area had Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Age cultures; controlled by Rome late 1st century CE; invaded by Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, who formed kingdoms by the 5th century and from whose Germanic languages English was primarily derived; Vikings invaded in 1016 and the Normans in 1066.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-2,53</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]]></address><name><![CDATA[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7007653">San Lorenzo de El Escorial</a>"</h1>Noted for elaborate monastery, palace, mausoleum and museum; Philip II built monastery 1563-1584 as memorial to victory over French in 1557; became his main residence; later was the dynastic center of the Spanish Hapsburgs.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-4.15,40.5833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Livorno]]></address><name><![CDATA[Livorno]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006074">Livorno</a>"</h1>Located on Ligurian Sea, surrounded by low hills; was given by countess Matilda of Tuscany to Pisan church in 1103; flourished as commercial center; went to Visconti family in 1399, to Genoa &amp; then to Florence in 15th cen.; was damaged in WW II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.3,43.55</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Portici]]></address><name><![CDATA[Portici]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006841">Portici</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14.3333,40.8167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[]]></address><name><![CDATA[]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7007023 7007018"/>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Berlin]]></address><name><![CDATA[Berlin]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003712">Berlin</a>"</h1>The city of Berlin in the state of Berlin lies on both sides of the Spree River in its wide glacial valley in the center of unified Germany. Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.4167,52.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

The region is composed of four broad belts of land stretching from north to south: in the west the high Pennine moorlands dissected by the Yorkshire Dales; in the southeast the central lowlands (including the Vale of York) draining into the River Humber estuary; in the east the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds; and, farther southeast, the Holderness plain along the North Sea. Yorkshire was bordered by the historic counties of Durham to the north, Westmorland to the northwest, Lancashire to the west, Cheshire and Derbyshire to the southwest, and Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the southeast. Yorkshire is now composed of all or most of the following administrative units: the county of North Yorkshire; the unitary authorities of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull, and York; the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees south of the River Tees; and all or most of every metropolitan borough in the metropolitan counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The exceptions are the parish of Finningley and the area west of Bawtry (both in the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire) which lie within the historic county of Nottinghamshire; the area around Beighton and Mosborough in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, which belongs to the historic county of Derbyshire; and the area west of Todmorden in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which lies within the historic county of Lancashire. The historic county also includes three large areas in other administrative units: much of the eastern part of the administrative county of Lancashire and much of the borough of Ribble Valley, including the entire Forest of Bowland region; Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh in the South Lakeland district of the administrative county of Cumbria; the area south of the Tees in the Teesdale district of the administrative county of Durham; and small areas along the southeast border of the historic county of Yorkshire lie in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. Yorkshire has a rich history: there are many prehistoric remains, including the impressive earthworks at Stanwick, and it was a Roman military stronghold from the 1st to the 5th century CE. After a time being controlled by indigenous Britons, Yorkshire became part of the kingdom of Deira from the 6th to the 9th century. It was taken by Danes 875 and recaptured by kings of Wessex 954. The region remained strongly Anglo-Scandinavian in culture until the Normans took control in 1069. Important monasteries were founded here and large artistocratic estates were established. After the Black Death of the 14th century, most of Yorkshire's crop land became pasture for sheep and woolen manufacture became an important industry. It was the base for Yorkists during War of the Roses (1455-1485) and two of the most important battles were fought here (Wakefield and Towton, 1460 and 1461). The battle at Marston Moor in 1644 was one of the most crucial of the English Civil Wars. Yorkshire's long history has left behind an outstanding array of architecture: pre-Norman churches; impressive ruined abbeys such as Rievaulx; castles such as Bolton; the outstanding Gothic York Minster; and notable country houses such as 18th-century Castle Howard.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Versailles, Château de]]></address><name><![CDATA[Versailles, Château de]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1100363">Versailles, Château de</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.1167,48.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places.

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.4167,52.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Siena]]></address><name><![CDATA[Siena]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011179">Siena</a>"</h1>Siena was founded as an Etruscan hill town; later it was the Roman city of Sena Julia (3rd century BCE).

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures.

The site of an ancient settlement, the Romans knew it as Leodium. It was established as a town and bishopric in 721. It became a noted center of learning and art in the Middle Ages. Strife between the guilds and the nobles dominated the early 14th century until political equality was granted to the laborers and to most of the trade guilds in 1313. The town was sacked by Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 15th century, but after his death was rebuilt and prospered. Both France and England attacked it during the War of Spanish Succession. The reign of the nobles ended in 1789, but then France took the town in 1795. After the creation of Belgium in 1830, the town flourished as an industrial center. The German army occupied it in both world wars, and it suffered heavy bombardment in the Second World War. Today it produces steel, coal, glass, copper, and armaments. It has many Romanesque and Gothic churches, and the former palace of the prince-bishops, now the Palais de Justice. It is the cultural center of Wallonie, with many museums and concert halls, an opera, theatre, the state university, the preserved house of the composer César Franck, and the Royal Conservatory of Music.

Orléans was conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BCE; many Roman ruins have been found here. It was the most important city in France after Paris during the 10th and 11th centuries and it was the center of the royal duchy established by Philip VI in 1344. Orléans was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. The symbol of Saint James, the scalloped shell, became the primary symbol representing pilgrims. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Orléans is known as the city that was saved by the heroine Joan of Arc. An equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in the center of town and the large Gothic-style Cathedral of Sainte-Croix are historic landmarks.  Modern Orléans is a center for gardening and horticulture; it is particularly known for its roses. Other industries in Orléans include textiles, food processing, machinery manufacturing, and electrical engineering.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>1.9,47.9</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Lyon]]></address><name><![CDATA[Lyon]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008772">Lyon</a>"</h1>Residence of Roman emperors; sacked by Huns and Visigoths; taken by Saracens in the 8th century; incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032; united to the French crown in 1312; prospered in the 16th century but declined during the wars of religion; scene of revolts in the 19th century.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.8333,45.7667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Paris]]></address><name><![CDATA[Paris]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008038">Paris</a>"</h1>Paris is the city and capital of France, located in the north-central part of the country.

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[İstanbul]]></address><name><![CDATA[İstanbul]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002473">İstanbul</a>"</h1>Held by Persian Empire 512 BCE; Roman Republic free city; seat of Constantine I's empire from 330; declared a Christian city by Constantine; attacked by Persians, Arabs, Bulgars and Russians during the 6th-13th centuries; taken by Fourth Crusade army in 1203; taken by Ottomans.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>28.95,41.0333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[London]]></address><name><![CDATA[London]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011781">London</a>"</h1>Longtime seat of the British Empire and capital of the United Kingdom.

By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.4167,51.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Italia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Italia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000080">Italia</a>"</h1>Inhabited since 50,000 BCE; settled by Indo-Europeans 1850 BCE, Etruscans 1600 BCE, and Greeks 800 BCE; united by Romans 270 BCE; independent states rose after fall of Holy Roman Empire, notably Naples, Milan, Florence, Venice and papacy; reunited in the 19th century; official language is Italian, though significant minorities speak German, French, and Slovene.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.8333,42.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Babylon]]></address><name><![CDATA[Babylon]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002626">Babylon</a>"</h1>Was a thriving ancient center on the Euphrates river.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research.

Originally a Celtic settlement, a Roman military camp was founded here by the Roman general Drusus 14-9 BCE. It became self-governing from 1118 to 1462, when a rebellion caused it to lose its free city privileges, and the leader of the league of Rhenish towns from 1254. It was a French possession from 1797 to 1815, and occupied by the French army from 1918 to 1930. It was almost totally destroyed in World War II, but has been rebuilt. Surviving historic architecture includes an 11th-century Romanesque cathedral, a 17th-century elector's palace, and a 19th-century German fortress built on the site of the old Roman military post. Mainz had a university from 1477 to 1816, but a new one, the Johannes Gutenberg University, it in 1946, honoring its native son who invented movable type here. The city is an educational center, with the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, the Institute for Economic Research, and the Academy of Sciences and Literature. There are many museums of art, history, and natural history, the Gutenberg Museum among them. The city's economic activities include the wine trade for the Rhineland, the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, machinery, glassware, and musical instruments. It is known for its wine and pre-Lenten festivals. The 2005 population was calculated at 187,940.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>8.2667,50</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Köln]]></address><name><![CDATA[Köln]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004446">Köln</a>"</h1>The western German city of Cologne is situated on the west bank of the Rhine. The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>6.95,50.9333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Luxembourg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Luxembourg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003514">Luxembourg</a>"</h1>Inhabited by Belgic Treveri tribe when Romans invaded 57 BC; Germanic tribes invaded ca. 400; part of Frankish kingdom of Austrasia, &amp; of Carolingian empire; ruled by counts of Luxembourg 11th cen., by Burgundy 1440s; was part of Spanish Netherlands; languages are French (used for civil service, law &amp; parliament) &amp; German (used by the press), &amp; spoken tongue is the Letzeburgish dialect (of Moselle Frankish origin).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>6.1667,49.75</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Venezia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Venezia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7018159">Venezia</a>"</h1>The islands of the Venetian lagoon were settled by refugees from Altino and Aquileia after the Lombard invasion of northern Italy in 568.

It was the site of Bronze Age and Roman settlements, was destroyed by the Alemanni in the 5th century, then rebuilt by the Franks. It was a leading medieval commercial and banking center; and was an important site in the development of Lutheranism in the 16th century. It declined in power during the Thirty Years War and passed to Bavaria in 1806. The artists Hans Holbein, the Elder and the Younger, and Hans Burgkmair were born in the town. Augsburg is the administrative capital of the Bavarian district of Swabia. It was the site of a firestorm caused by bombardment in World War II and was severely damaged, but much of its historic architecture survived to be restored. The city is rich in Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque buildings and fountains. It has a university founded in 1970, three colleges of music, and a technical college. In 1974, Augsburg annexed two neighboring cities, Göggingen and Haunstetten. It has grown to be a major site for heavy industry, chemicals, metal, and electrical plants.

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Biberach]]></address><name><![CDATA[Biberach]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7013234">Biberach</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>8.0333,48.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10,56</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Rossiya]]></address><name><![CDATA[Rossiya]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7002435">Rossiya</a>"</h1>Area was inhabited by many early cultures including Scythians (7th century BCE), Sarmatians, Goths (3rd century CE), Huns, Avars, Khazars, Bulgars, and Slavs; Varangians (Scandinavians) created Russian state in the 9th century; was core of large empire and Soviet Union (1922); official language is Russian.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>47,60</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.0667,49.45</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Nürnberg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Nürnberg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004334">Nürnberg</a>"</h1>Situated on the Pegnitz River in Bavaria, Germany, the city of Nürnberg is the second-largest city in Bavaria.

It was inhabited in Paleolithic times and was the site of mining in the Bronze Age. It was settled by Celts and became part of the Celtic kingdoms of Noricum, later incorporated into the Roman Empire ca. 15BCE and named Pannonia. Germanic people invaded it in the 5th century CE, followed by the Avars and Slovenes. Bavarians ruled it from ca. 780, and it became a frontier territory of the Frankish Empire. It became a duchy in 1180 and passed to the Babenberg dukes of Austria in 1192, then to the family of Hapsburg in 1276. After World War I part of its southern area was ceded to Yugoslavia. Since then, except for a brief period as a district under the German annexation, 1938-1945, it has been a federal province of Austria. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>15.1667,47.1667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

Only a few ruins of the city remain today on the Cadmea, the acropolis of ancient Thebes. It was named for Cadmus, the mythical founder of the city. Thebes was the main city of ancient Boeotia, and is identified with many legends, including stories of Dirce, Epigonus, Oedipus and the Sphinx. It entered a power struggle with Athens in the 6th cen. BCE. It was destroyed by Alexander the Great.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>23.3167,38.3167</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

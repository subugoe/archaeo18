It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.25,43.783</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[France]]></address><name><![CDATA[France]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000070">France</a>"</h1>Area inhabited by Lower Paleolithic; Celt-speaking Gauls dominated by 5th century BCE; part of Roman Empire 125 BCE-5th century, then under Frankish influence; lost land to England 12th-16th centuries; monarchy fell in Revolution 1792; recurring expansion 16-19th centuries; official language is French, though Proven√ßal, Breton, Flemish, Catalan, Corsican, Basque, and Germanic regional patois are also spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2,46</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

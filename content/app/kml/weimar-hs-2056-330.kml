The first reference to Media is found in the writings of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858-824 BCE), who referred to the country as Mada. The inhabitants gradually became known as Medes. According to Herodotus, Media and its capital Ecbatana (present day Hamadan) were founded by Deioces, son of Phraortes (ca. 715 BCE). Cyaxares, Deioces' grandson, led the revolt against the Assyrian empire, with Media expanding into Armenia, Îrān, and northern Assyria. In 550 BCE, Cyrus II (the Great) gained control over Media, making it part of the Achaemenian empire. Alexander the Great conquered Media, and divided it, giving the northern region to his general Atropates, who created the kingdom of Atropatene. Southern Media became part of the Seleucid empire. In ca. 152 BCE, Mithradates, the Parthian king, conquered southern Media and after a period of rule by the Arsacids, it, along with Atropatene, became part of the Sasanian empire. Effectively, Media was usurped into Persia. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Assyria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Assyria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016606">Assyria</a>"</h1>A large kingdom in Northern Mesopotamia, in what is now northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. The Assyrians were a Semitic people who spoke a dialect of Akkadian. Assyria was a dependency of Babylonia and later of the Mitanni kingdom during most of the 2nd millennium BCE. It became independent in the 14th century BCE and subsequently became a major power in Mesopotamia, Armenia, and sometimes in northern Syria. In the 9th century BCE the kingdom saw expansion and from the mid-8th to the late 7th century BCE, a series of strong Assyrian rulers united most of the Middle East, from Egypt to the Persian Gulf, under Assyrian rule. The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal. The empire was defeated by a Chaldean-Median coalition in 612-609 BCE. The Assyrians were noted for the fighting ability and cruelty. They were also monumental builders, as seen at the impressive sites of Nineveh, Ashur, and Nimrud.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Persia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Persia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7024079">Persia</a>"</h1>Includes area of Persian culture roughly corresponding to modern Iran; name derived from a region of southern Iran known as Parsa inhabited by Indo-European people around 1000 BCE also known as Parsa; flourished during rule of Persian Achaemenid dynasty from 559 to 330 BCE, ended with conquest by Alexander the Great.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>56,32</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Kermān]]></address><name><![CDATA[Kermān]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=6001173">Kermān</a>"</h1>Ancient region of eastern Persia.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>26.25,39.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ionien]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ionien]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7232897">Ionien</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Iónioi Nísoi]]></address><name><![CDATA[Iónioi Nísoi]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001338">Iónioi Nísoi</a>"</h1>Group of mountainous islands in the Ionian Sea off S coast of Peloponnesus; colonized by ancient Greeks, later occupied by Rome and then Byzantine Empire; ruled by Venice 1386-1797, by France from 1797; under Russian, then British protection in 19th century.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>20.5,38.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE). The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens.

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE).

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Red Sea]]></address><name><![CDATA[Red Sea]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016791">Red Sea</a>"</h1>Inland sea between the Arabian Peninsula &amp; NE Africa, connected to Mediterranean &amp; to Arabian Seas.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>42,15</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Adule, (jetzt Azuna)]]></address><name><![CDATA[Adule, (jetzt Azuna)]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016790">Adule, (jetzt Azuna)</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[]]></address><name><![CDATA[]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001407 6004687 7030348"/>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

The greatest Molossian king Pyrrhus (319-272) led a coalition of Epirote tribes and brought prosperity to the region; after the Third Macedonian War (171-168), Epirus was transferred to Roman rule, under which it prospered. The famous Battle of Actium (31 BCE) took place off the coast of Epirus. When the Roman Empire split in 395 CE, Epirus was the westernmost province of the Eastern Empire. When the Byzantine Empire became fragmented, an independent principality was maintained in Epirus from 1204 CE.

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE).

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Wien]]></address><name><![CDATA[Wien]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003321">Wien</a>"</h1>Located on the Danube River, at a crossroads in the center of Europe. Formerly, Vienna was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a Celtic settlement, it became a Roman military settlement and was occupied by the Magyars in 907, then passed to the Babenburgs in 976. It became the capital of the duchy of Austria in 1156 and was occupied by Ottocar II of Bohemia from 1251 to 1276. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Turks in 1529 and 1683. During the 18th century, Vienna was one of the great cultural centers in Europe, the home of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. The city was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1805 and 1808 and from 1814 to 1815. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and liberated by the Russians in 1945.

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>8.4667,49.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sankt-Peterburg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sankt-Peterburg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010273">Sankt-Peterburg</a>"</h1>Located on Gulf of Finland; was important cultural center since 18th century; center of Russian Revolution 1917-1918; threatened by Hitler 1941-1942; nation's center for production of machinery and armaments; noted for 18th-century Winter Palace and Hermitage Museum.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>30.25,59.8833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Paris]]></address><name><![CDATA[Paris]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008038">Paris</a>"</h1>Paris is the city and capital of France, located in the north-central part of the country.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Middle East]]></address><name><![CDATA[Middle East]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001526">Middle East</a>"</h1>Extensive area, including nations of SW Asia &amp; NE Africa; term formerly used to also include Afghanistan, Pakistan, India &amp; Burma; term "Near East" is used to refer to the same general area as "Middle East," but may also be used to mean a larger area.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Thebes]]></address><name><![CDATA[Thebes]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001297">Thebes</a>"</h1>Was an ancient city of Upper Egypt, site of the royal residence and center of worship of Amon. It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Cithäron]]></address><name><![CDATA[Cithäron]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7229083">Cithäron</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements;

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years.

It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pelopónnisos]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pelopónnisos]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7017076">Pelopónnisos</a>"</h1>Area forming S part of mainland Greece; originally inhabited by Leges &amp; Pelasgians, who may have built Mycenae and Tiryns; Achaeans arrived 14th cen.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

However, its boundaries have changed many times over the centuries. It was settled by Slavic tribes in the 2nd millennium BCE, and over time saw incursions by Ostrogoths, Slavs, Huns and Avars. Many small states formed in the 9th century, until a united in kingdom emerged in 1025. It was part of the Polish-Lithuanian empire in the 15 and 16th centuries. It was subsequently invaded in turn by Tartars, Ottomans and Russians. Its territory shrank as it was overrun and partitioned by various European powers between the 18th and 20th centuries. Following World War II, it was dominated by the USSR and had a Communist government, which collapsed in 1989, to be followed by a Western-style democracy. The official language is Polish.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>20,52</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Aíyina]]></address><name><![CDATA[Aíyina]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7011088">Aíyina</a>"</h1>Located in Saronic gulf, off SE coast of Greece.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>8.4667,49.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[]]></address><name><![CDATA[]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/8002169"/>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Taranto]]></address><name><![CDATA[Taranto]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004100">Taranto</a>"</h1>Comprises old city on island &amp; newer section on mainland; reached height of military power 4th cen.

The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>6.95,50.9333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE). The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[San Ildefonso o La Granja]]></address><name><![CDATA[San Ildefonso o La Granja]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7007905">San Ildefonso o La Granja</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>-4,40.9</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pushkin]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pushkin]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010262">Pushkin</a>"</h1>Grew around one of the main summer palaces of Catherine the Great ca. 1717; palace enlarged 1743-1748 &amp; rebuilt in Russian Baroque style 1752-1757; gutted by Nazis in WW II &amp; restored later; noted for first railway of Russian Empire built 1837.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>30.3667,59.7167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Milano]]></address><name><![CDATA[Milano]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7005903">Milano</a>"</h1>One of nation's richest cities; became the second city of the western Roman Empire after Rome; sacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and by Goths in 539; battled for autonomy with nearby cities 11th-12th centuries; controlled by Sforza family 15th century and by Spain 1540-1706; won independence from Austria in 1848; heavily bombed during World War II.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.2,45.4667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Versailles]]></address><name><![CDATA[Versailles]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008070">Versailles</a>"</h1>Built by French kings on site of Louis XIII's hunting lodge; seat of court of Louis XIV who built large palace; meeting place of States-General in 1783; scene of several treaty signings; German headquarters 1870-1871; seat of French government 1871-1879.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.1333,48.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Kassel]]></address><name><![CDATA[Kassel]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004431">Kassel</a>"</h1>The city of Kassel is located on the Fulda River some 90 miles northeast of Frankfurt am Main. Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Ellás]]></address><name><![CDATA[Ellás]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000074">Ellás</a>"</h1>Paleolithic settlements; developed Minoan (Aegean) and Mycenaean (Indo-European) cultures 2000 BCE; Dorians invaded 12th century BCE, then Aeolians, Ionians; powerful states joined in leagues, colonized; conquered by Rome; part of Byzantine and Ottoman Empires; official language is Greek, though English and French are also widely spoken.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>22,39</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Thessalía]]></address><name><![CDATA[Thessalía]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001399">Thessalía</a>"</h1>Area hemmed in by mountains between Epirus &amp; the Aegean Sea; supported several prehistoric civilizations; settled by Thessalians in 2nd mill.

The famous Battle of Actium (31 BCE) took place off the coast of Epirus. When the Roman Empire split in 395 CE, Epirus was the westernmost province of the Eastern Empire. When the Byzantine Empire became fragmented, an independent principality was maintained in Epirus from 1204 CE.

The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates.

Its territory forms the core of the medieval margraviate of Hessen, and extends west to east from the Rhine Plateau to the Thuringian Forest. The original landmargraviate of Hesse was founded from a portion of Thuringia. Its ruler, Henry I, came to hold the rank of prince in the Holy Roman Empire in 1292. Under Philip the Magnanimous, Hesse was twice partitioned and reunited, finally to be divided into four sections, one for each of his sons. In 1945 the modern state was created from the Hesse territories and part of Nassau. The capital is Wiesbaden and its largest city is Frankfurt am Main. The state is known for its educational institutions, and for the ruined castles and old churches along the Weser River, and the many half-timbered houses scattered throughout. The economy features agriculture on small or large scales, and a great deal of manufacturing, primarily in the south.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>13.75,51.05</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Versailles]]></address><name><![CDATA[Versailles]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008070">Versailles</a>"</h1>Built by French kings on site of Louis XIII's hunting lodge; seat of court of Louis XIV who built large palace; meeting place of States-General in 1783; scene of several treaty signings; German headquarters 1870-1871; seat of French government 1871-1879.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.1333,48.8</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

It flourished under the Lombard kings (6th century CE) and was a Medieval self-governing commune (constitution dates to 1179). Siena was a Medieval seat of pro-imperial Ghibelline power and was an economic and territorial rival of Guelf (anti-imperial) Florence. The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11.3167,43.3167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Naxos]]></address><name><![CDATA[Naxos]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7003909">Naxos</a>"</h1>Was site of first Greek colony on Sicily; was founded in 8th cen.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Stockholm]]></address><name><![CDATA[Stockholm]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7009861">Stockholm</a>"</h1>Built upon numerous islands as well as on the mainland, primarily by the Swedish ruler Birger Jarl in 13th cen.; rapidly developed as member of Hanseatic League; extensively rebuilt in 1634; destroyed by fires &amp; rebuilt in 18th cen., expanded in 19th cen.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>18.0833,59.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Otricoli]]></address><name><![CDATA[Otricoli]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7005141">Otricoli</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.4833,42.4167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Paris]]></address><name><![CDATA[Paris]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008038">Paris</a>"</h1>Paris is the city and capital of France, located in the north-central part of the country.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens.

Capital of the Celtic tribe Allobroges and rival of Lyon in ancient times. Conquered by the Romans in 121 BCE, it became an important town of Roman Gaul. Late in the 9th century the town became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Vienne was the site of council held to suppress Knights Templars 1311-1312.  The town was transferred to French sovereignty in 1450. Roman remains including a temple of Augustus and Livia, a theater, and an obelisk can still be seen; there is also a museum of Roman antiquities. There are three important medieval churches here, the largest being Saint-Maurice Cathedral, built in the 12th-15th centuries. Present-day Vienne is a marketing center for the agricultural produce of the Rhône River valley. Its industries include textiles, metallurgy, and footwear. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.9,45.5333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

The original village grew up around a chapel on an island in the Zenne River. By the 6th century, it found itself located on an important trade route, and became a flourishing commercial center specializing in woolens in the medieval period. The merchant aristocracy was forced to share power with the craftsmen after their revolt in 1421. It was ruled successively by the Duke of Burgundy, then the Holy Roman Empire. It was part of the Spanish Netherlands from 1530, then of modern Belgium from 1830. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, it produced textiles, chemicals, electrical equipment, machinery, rubber goods and brewed beverages.

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany.

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.5667,55.7167</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Stockholm]]></address><name><![CDATA[Stockholm]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7009861">Stockholm</a>"</h1>Built upon numerous islands as well as on the mainland, primarily by the Swedish ruler Birger Jarl in 13th cen.; rapidly developed as member of Hanseatic League; extensively rebuilt in 1634; destroyed by fires &amp; rebuilt in 18th cen., expanded in 19th cen.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>18.0833,59.3333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sankt-Peterburg]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sankt-Peterburg]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010273">Sankt-Peterburg</a>"</h1>Located on Gulf of Finland; was important cultural center since 18th century; center of Russian Revolution 1917-1918; threatened by Hitler 1941-1942; nation's center for production of machinery and armaments; noted for 18th-century Winter Palace and Hermitage Museum.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>30.25,59.8833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sozopol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sozopol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7010664">Sozopol</a>"</h1>The town of Sozopol on the Black Sea in the region of Burgas in Bulgaria was first settled ca. 620 BCE by Ionian Greeks.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy.

Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Italia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Italia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000080">Italia</a>"</h1>Inhabited since 50,000 BCE; settled by Indo-Europeans 1850 BCE, Etruscans 1600 BCE, and Greeks 800 BCE; united by Romans 270 BCE; independent states rose after fall of Holy Roman Empire, notably Naples, Milan, Florence, Venice and papacy; reunited in the 19th century; official language is Italian, though significant minorities speak German, French, and Slovene.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.8333,42.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Asia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Asia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000004">Asia</a>"</h1>Largest continent; was home to early hominids; developed domestication of animals &amp; crops by 9000 BCE; developed complex early cultures in Mesopotamia, India &amp; China.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Firenze]]></address><name><![CDATA[Firenze]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000457">Firenze</a>"</h1>The original settlement was a Roman military center at the head of navigation on the Arno river and on the Casian Way.

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland.

In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places.

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor.

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>26.25,39.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008331">Magna Graecia</a>"</h1>Refers to a group of ancient Greek seaport colonies along the coast of southern Italy, which grew as part of the Greek expansion of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Sicilia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030363">Sicilia</a>"</h1>Home to Stone Age Sicani, Elymi and Siculi (arrived from toe of Italy ca. 1000 BCE). The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Capitol]]></address><name><![CDATA[Capitol]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/500002">Capitol</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Tivoli]]></address><name><![CDATA[Tivoli]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006968">Tivoli</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.8,41.9667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[]]></address><name><![CDATA[]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=hp//arachn.uni-koln.d/im/opographi/8002083"/>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Palestrina]]></address><name><![CDATA[Palestrina]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7007001">Palestrina</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.9,41.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Nīl, Nahr an-]]></address><name><![CDATA[Nīl, Nahr an-]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1127805">Nīl, Nahr an-</a>"</h1>Longest river in the world, rising south of the equator and flowing through northeastern Africa, draining in the Mediterranean;

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>9.5,51.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Mit Rahina]]></address><name><![CDATA[Mit Rahina]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001186">Mit Rahina</a>"</h1>The modern village of Mit Rahina partially covers the ancient city of Memphis, which was the capital of Menes, for most rulers of Old and Middle Kingdoms until the 18th dynasty; it was superseded by Heracleopolis and later by Thebes; declined after Alexander's conquest.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>31.25,29.85</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Italia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Italia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000080">Italia</a>"</h1>Inhabited since 50,000 BCE; settled by Indo-Europeans 1850 BCE, Etruscans 1600 BCE, and Greeks 800 BCE; united by Romans 270 BCE; independent states rose after fall of Holy Roman Empire, notably Naples, Milan, Florence, Venice and papacy; reunited in the 19th century; official language is Italian, though significant minorities speak German, French, and Slovene.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>12.8333,42.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Gallia Cisalpina]]></address><name><![CDATA[Gallia Cisalpina]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=6002195">Gallia Cisalpina</a>"</h1>Roman province in the area of northern Italy between the Apennines and the Alps.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Etruria]]></address><name><![CDATA[Etruria]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7024113">Etruria</a>"</h1>Includes area of Etruscan culture in central Italy, particularly confederation of 12 city states; Etruscans possibly arrived from Asia Minor in 9th century BCE, or were of local origins; modern scholars believe they include early Villanovan culture; economy was based on agriculture, mining iron and copper, and harvesting forests; was noted as fierce maritime power; flourished in the 7th-3rd centuries BCE, culture had been absorbed by Roman culture by 1st century BCE.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>11,43.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>14,37.5</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Magna Graecia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008331">Magna Graecia</a>"</h1>Refers to a group of ancient Greek seaport colonies along the coast of southern Italy, which grew as part of the Greek expansion of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pestum]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pestum]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7054730">Pestum</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Roma]]></address><name><![CDATA[Roma]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7000874">Roma</a>"</h1>On 7 hills over swampy Tiber river; Etruscan city by 8th cen.

According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166. The modern city is known worldwide for its technical and scientific educational institutions. The principal industries are metalworking and the production of vehicles. It is a transportation center with an airport and railway junction. Other notable economic activities are the sugar trade and the production and marketing of asparagus, sausage, and gingerbread. The 2004 estimated population was 245,600.  <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.5,52.25</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Napoli]]></address><name><![CDATA[Napoli]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7004474">Napoli</a>"</h1>Founded on site of Parthenope by refugees from Cumae; conquered by Romans 4th cen.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>32.6667,25.6833</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East.

It was the center of Hellenic scholarship and science in antiquity. It was built by the Greek architect Dinocrates for Alexander the Great. It was the renowned capital of the Ptolemies when they ruled Egypt. It was noted for its library and a great lighthouse on the island of Pharos. It was captured by Caesar in 48 BCE, taken by Arabs in 640 and by Turks in 1517. The city was famed for being the site of convergence of Greek, Arab and Jewish ideas. It was occupied by the French 1798-1801, by the British in 1892; evacuated by the British in 1946.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>29.9,31.2</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Dacia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Dacia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7030323">Dacia</a>"</h1>Ancient region generally described as the area of the Carpathian Mountains and Transylvania, in present north-central and western Romania. The Dacians had earlier occupied lands south of the Danube and north of the mountains, and the Roman province eventually included wider territories to the north and east. The Dacians spoke a Thracian dialect but were influenced culturally by the neighboring Scythians and by the Celtic invaders of the 4th century BCE. They worked in agriculture and in the local silver, gold, and iron mines. The Dacian Wars (85-89 CE) under the emperor Domitian resulted in Roman rule; hostilities resumed under Trajan. The provinces was divided under Hadrian into Dacia Superior and Dacia Inferior and was redivided in 159 by Antoninus Pius into the Tres Daciae (Dacia Porolissensis, Dacia Apulensis, and Dacia Malvensis). Marcus Aurelius made the provinces a single military region, ca. 168 CE. The border of the Roman territory might not have been clearly defined, but the empire benefitted both militarily and materially from the occupation.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark></Document></kml>

It was founded more than 2,000 years ago on an island in the Seine River. The City of Paris itself covers an area of 41 square miles (105 square kilometers). It occupies a central position in the productive agricultural region known as the Paris Basin. It is the nation's most important center of commerce and culture. It was captured and fortified by the Romans in 52 BCE and ruled by various other groups such as the Clovis, Northmen, English, and Germans.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.3333,48.8667</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Pisa]]></address><name><![CDATA[Pisa]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7006082">Pisa</a>"</h1>Located on Arno river, six miles from Ligurian sea, it was developed as Roman naval base. It became a leading medieval city-state and maritime power; made commercial contacts in Syria during the 11th-century Crusades. Pisa was a Ghibelline stronghold; a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and their Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo). Pisa was held by Florence from the 15th century.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10.4,43.7167</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

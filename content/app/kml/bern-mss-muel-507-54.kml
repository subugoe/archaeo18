Under the early empire, Syria, which stretched northeast to the upper Euphrates and, until AD 73, included eastern Cilicia, became one of the most important provinces. Later Ituraea was incorporated and Judaea became its own province (later Syria Palaestina). Commagene was permanently annexed by Vespasian in 72 and the important caravan city of Palmyra came under Roman control, possibly during the reign of Tiberius. The province of Syria was itself divided into Syria Coele in the north and Syria Phoenice in the south. By the early 5th century it was subdivided into at least five provinces. The frontiers of the province were guarded by a fortified limes system.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Egypt]]></address><name><![CDATA[Egypt]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7014986">Egypt</a>"</h1>Egypt produced one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East. With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Adulæ]]></address><name><![CDATA[Adulæ]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7016790">Adulæ</a>"</h1><p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Arabian Peninsula]]></address><name><![CDATA[Arabian Peninsula]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1012700">Arabian Peninsula</a>"</h1>Home to Minaean and Sabaean kingdoms 1000 BCE; held by Assyrians, Hebrews, Romans, and Persians; home to Semitic tribes until Mohammed initiated consolidation 7th century; ruled by Mamelukes and Ottomans; resistance to Turks 18-19th centuries; modern states born 1930s.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>45,25</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

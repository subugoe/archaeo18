French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Saint-Denis developed around the abbey built by Dagobert I in 626, over the tomb of St. Denis. There is a famous 12th-century abbatial church which contains tombs of French monarchs. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.3833,48.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

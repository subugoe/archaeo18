First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor.

In the 1950s three East German Bezirke, or national districts, were formed of the historic Saxon region. After the reunification of Germany, all or parts of these three districts were made into the German state of Saxony. It measures some 7080 square miles in area and has a population of about 4, 278,000. Its capital is Dresden. Except for the northern portion around Leipzig, which belongs to the North European Plain, the state is mostly mountainous in terrain. It is drained by the Elbe river, which runs northwest to southeast, and the Mulde, a tributary of the Elbe. Saxony's principal mountain range is the Ore Mountains, which run for about 100 miles along its southern border. The state has rich soil and its agriculture is highly developed, grains being important throughout most of the state, while cattle are the main product in the Ore Mountains. Forestry and the mining of tin, lead, and coal are also important. The main industries are the production of textiles and of machinery used in textile production, papermaking, printing, and mining. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>10,52.8333</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Document></kml>

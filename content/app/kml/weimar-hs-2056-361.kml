Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Saint-Denis]]></address><name><![CDATA[Saint-Denis]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7009706">Saint-Denis</a>"</h1>Saint-Denis was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Saint-Denis developed around the abbey built by Dagobert I in 626, over the tomb of St. Denis. There is a famous 12th-century abbatial church which contains tombs of French monarchs. <p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>2.3833,48.95</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Troyes]]></address><name><![CDATA[Troyes]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7008350">Troyes</a>"</h1>Converted to Christianity 3rd cen.; sacked by Normans 889; site of the great Champagne fairs; gave name to measuring system first used at fairs (troy weights); scene of signing of Treaty of Troyes 1420; scene where Joan of Arc expelled English 1429.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description><Point><coordinates>4.0833,48.3</coordinates></Point></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Venezia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Venezia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7018159">Venezia</a>"</h1>The islands of the Venetian lagoon were settled by refugees from Altino and Aquileia after the Lombard invasion of northern Italy in 568.

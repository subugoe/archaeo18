The greatest Molossian king Pyrrhus (319-272) led a coalition of Epirote tribes and brought prosperity to the region; after the Third Macedonian War (171-168), Epirus was transferred to Roman rule, under which it prospered. The famous Battle of Actium (31 BCE) took place off the coast of Epirus. When the Roman Empire split in 395 CE, Epirus was the westernmost province of the Eastern Empire. When the Byzantine Empire became fragmented, an independent principality was maintained in Epirus from 1204 CE.

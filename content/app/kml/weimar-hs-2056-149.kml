It was inhabited by the an Indo-European Illyrians, a loosely united Balkan people. It was taken in the 1st century BCE by Rome after a long war and became a prefecture and then a province; during this period Illyricum enjoyed a great deal of prosperity. The Roman province stretched from the Drilon River (the Drin, in modern Albania) in the south to Istria (modern Slovenia and Croatia) in the north and to the Savus (Sava) River in the east; its administrative center was Salonae (near present-day Split) in Dalmatia. As the empire expanded along the Danube River valley, Illyricum was divided between the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia. Several of the most outstanding emperors of the late Roman Empire were of Illyrian origin, including Claudius II Gothicus, Aurelian, Diocletian, and Constantine the Great. When the Roman empire was divided in 395 CE, Illyria east of the Drinus River became part of the Eastern empire. By the end of the 7th century, invading Slavs had transformed the ethnic structure of all the Illyrian-speaking territories. Croatia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, and parts of Macedonia lost their Illyrian language, so that the Albanians remain as the only direct descendants of the ancient Illyrians.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark><Placemark><address><![CDATA[Macedonia]]></address><name><![CDATA[Macedonia]]></name><description><![CDATA[<h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7001349">Macedonia</a>"</h1>Refers to a general area with indefinite boundaries that is divided between Greece, Bulgaria and the Vardar valley of former Yugoslavia (now Makedonija). It was the ancient kingdom of the Macedonians and later became the Roman province of Macedonia. Rome took this area during the Macedonian Wars; under Roman control Macedonia at first (168-146 BCE) formed four independent republics without common bonds. In 146 BCE it became a Roman province with the four sections as administrative units. It was divided into the provinces of Macedonia and Macedonia Secunda ca. 400 CE, within the diocese of Moesia.<p>Description from <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Thesaurus</a></p>]]></description></Placemark></Document></kml>

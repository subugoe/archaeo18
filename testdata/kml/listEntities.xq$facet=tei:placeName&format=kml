The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The greatest Molossian king Pyrrhus (319-272) led a coalition of Epirote tribes and brought prosperity to the region; after the Third Macedonian War (171-168), Epirus was transferred to Roman rule, under which it prospered. The famous Battle of Actium (31 BCE) took place off the coast of Epirus. When the Roman Empire split in 395 CE, Epirus was the westernmost province of the Eastern Empire. When the Byzantine Empire became fragmented, an independent principality was maintained in Epirus from 1204 CE.

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

However, its boundaries have changed many times over the centuries. It was settled by Slavic tribes in the 2nd millennium BCE, and over time saw incursions by Ostrogoths, Slavs, Huns and Avars. Many small states formed in the 9th century, until a united in kingdom emerged in 1025. It was part of the Polish-Lithuanian empire in the 15 and 16th centuries. It was subsequently invaded in turn by Tartars, Ottomans and Russians. Its territory shrank as it was overrun and partitioned by various European powers between the 18th and 20th centuries. Following World War II, it was dominated by the USSR and had a Communist government, which collapsed in 1989, to be followed by a Western-style democracy. The official language is Polish.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The greatest Molossian king Pyrrhus (319-272) led a coalition of Epirote tribes and brought prosperity to the region; after the Third Macedonian War (171-168), Epirus was transferred to Roman rule, under which it prospered. The famous Battle of Actium (31 BCE) took place off the coast of Epirus. When the Roman Empire split in 395 CE, Epirus was the westernmost province of the Eastern Empire. When the Byzantine Empire became fragmented, an independent principality was maintained in Epirus from 1204 CE.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

Its territory forms the core of the medieval margraviate of Hessen, and extends west to east from the Rhine Plateau to the Thuringian Forest. The original landmargraviate of Hesse was founded from a portion of Thuringia. Its ruler, Henry I, came to hold the rank of prince in the Holy Roman Empire in 1292. Under Philip the Magnanimous, Hesse was twice partitioned and reunited, finally to be divided into four sections, one for each of his sons. In 1945 the modern state was created from the Hesse territories and part of Nassau. The capital is Wiesbaden and its largest city is Frankfurt am Main. The state is known for its educational institutions, and for the ruined castles and old churches along the Weser River, and the many half-timbered houses scattered throughout. The economy features agriculture on small or large scales, and a great deal of manufacturing, primarily in the south. The 2004 estimated population was 6,105,200]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins.

It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

Capital of the Celtic tribe Allobroges and rival of Lyon in ancient times. Conquered by the Romans in 121 BCE, it became an important town of Roman Gaul. Late in the 9th century the town became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Vienne was the site of council held to suppress Knights Templars 1311-1312.  The town was transferred to French sovereignty in 1450. Roman remains including a temple of Augustus and Livia, a theater, and an obelisk can still be seen; there is also a museum of Roman antiquities. There are three important medieval churches here, the largest being Saint-Maurice Cathedral, built in the 12th-15th centuries. Present-day Vienne is a marketing center for the agricultural produce of the Rhône River valley. Its industries include textiles, metallurgy, and footwear. ]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The original village grew up around a chapel on an island in the Zenne River. By the 6th century, it found itself located on an important trade route, and became a flourishing commercial center specializing in woolens in the medieval period. The merchant aristocracy was forced to share power with the craftsmen after their revolt in 1421. It was ruled successively by the Duke of Burgundy, then the Holy Roman Empire. It was part of the Spanish Netherlands from 1530, then of modern Belgium from 1830. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, it produced textiles, chemicals, electrical equipment, machinery, rubber goods and brewed beverages. It has become something of an international capital since it became the headquarters of the European Union.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.]]></description>

Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. ]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

Historically it has been in a strategic position guarding the Brenner Pass. Originally inhabited by Rhaetic tribes, it went to Rome in 15 BCE. Teutonic tribes took it over at the end of the western Roman Empire, then the Franks. The Hapsburgs ruled it from 1363 until 1918. After World War I, South Tyrol became part of Italy, which it remains to this day. ]]></description>

Formerly, Vienna was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a Celtic settlement, it became a Roman military settlement and was occupied by the Magyars in 907, then passed to the Babenburgs in 976. It became the capital of the duchy of Austria in 1156 and was occupied by Ottocar II of Bohemia from 1251 to 1276. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Turks in 1529 and 1683. During the 18th century, Vienna was one of the great cultural centers in Europe, the home of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. The city was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1805 and 1808 and from 1814 to 1815. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and liberated by the Russians in 1945. The historic centre of Vienna was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.]]></description>

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.]]></description>

            <h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1000066">Dänemark</a>"</h1>The nation of Denmark occupies the Jutland Peninsula, extending northwards from the center of western Europe, and some 400 islands to the east of it. It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.]]></description>

According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166. The modern city is known worldwide for its technical and scientific educational institutions. The principal industries are metalworking and the production of vehicles. It is a transportation center with an airport and railway junction. Other notable economic activities are the sugar trade and the production and marketing of asparagus, sausage, and gingerbread.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy.

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166. The modern city is known worldwide for its technical and scientific educational institutions. The principal industries are metalworking and the production of vehicles. It is a transportation center with an airport and railway junction. Other notable economic activities are the sugar trade and the production and marketing of asparagus, sausage, and gingerbread. The 2004 estimated population was 245,600.  ]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

It is first mentioned under the name Guting in 953. Receiving its charter in 1211, it became a powerful member of the Hanseatic League in the 14th century. It sustained severe damage during the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, but revived with the founding of the University of Göttingen, which soon became known of one of the best in Europe. The dismissal of seven professors (including J and K Grimm) in 1837 caused a sharp decline in its academic reputation and hence the prosperity of the city. Strong math and physics faculties eventually restored its good name in the late 19th century. The university's library has one of the finest collections in Europe and draws many visitors. Largely undamaged during World War II, the city retains much of its historic architecture, including whole streets of medieval half-timbered buildings, the city ramparts, and several Gothic churches. Its industries include tourism, the production of optical and precision instruments and printing. Its 2004 estimated population was 123,100.]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).]]></description>

It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

It was inhabited by the an Indo-European Illyrians, a loosely united Balkan people. It was taken in the 1st century BCE by Rome after a long war and became a prefecture and then a province; during this period Illyricum enjoyed a great deal of prosperity. The Roman province stretched from the Drilon River (the Drin, in modern Albania) in the south to Istria (modern Slovenia and Croatia) in the north and to the Savus (Sava) River in the east; its administrative center was Salonae (near present-day Split) in Dalmatia. As the empire expanded along the Danube River valley, Illyricum was divided between the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia. Several of the most outstanding emperors of the late Roman Empire were of Illyrian origin, including Claudius II Gothicus, Aurelian, Diocletian, and Constantine the Great. When the Roman empire was divided in 395 CE, Illyria east of the Drinus River became part of the Eastern empire. By the end of the 7th century, invading Slavs had transformed the ethnic structure of all the Illyrian-speaking territories. Croatia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, and parts of Macedonia lost their Illyrian language, so that the Albanians remain as the only direct descendants of the ancient Illyrians.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).

Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770. The modern city boasts educational and scientific institutions, and healthy industries in bootbuilding, food processing, locomotive building, and textiles. The 2004 estimated population was 131,900.]]></description>

It rises in the west of Italy in the Cottian Alps, in the Monte Viso group. It empties into the Adriatic Sea. The river carries a very large sediment load, which expands the delta by around 200 acres per year. Ravenna and other ancient ports south of the delta are now miles from the sea as a result of silt from the Po carried down by currents in the Adriatic. The floods of the river and the silt load carried by it have long challenged hydraulic engineers; river regulation works originated in pre-Roman times, work was resumed in the Middle Ages, and the present arrangement existed by the end of the 15th century. Numerous projects have been undertaken in various areas of the river, including the Venetian Republic's having built dikes to control floods and canals to divert silt, and the Italian Land Reform's project to reclaim land in 1953.]]></description>

Although archeological findings indicate prehistoric settlements, inscriptions claim the city was built during the reign of Darius I (reg 522-486 BCE), who replaced Pasargadae with Persepolis as the capital. The city and castle of Xerxes I, Darius's son, (reg 485-465 BCE), was destroyed by Alexander the Great. In 316 BCE, Persepolis became the capital of Persis, a Macedonian empire, and then began to decline during the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE). By the 3rd century CE, the neaby city of Istakhr became the center of the Sasanian empire. Investigation of Persepolis' ruins began in 1618 by García Silva Figueroa, a Spanish ambassador to Persia who found references of the ancient city in the works by Quintus Curtius, Diodorus and Plutarch. In 1626, Englishman Thomas Herbert, published the first engraving of the ruins. Archaeological excavations at the site commenced in 1931 under Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt of the University of Chicago from 1931-1939, and through 1979 by Îrānian archaeologists.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. ]]></description>

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.]]></description>

The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Under the name Apollonia it became an important center for the trade in northern European products such as amber, salt, and iron. It was the site of a celebrated Sanctuary of Apollo, and then the seat of a bishop during Byzantine Empire.

            <h1>Description of "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=7029624">Pontus</a>"</h1>The historic region of Pontos roughly encompassed most of the eastern Black Sea coast of northeastern Asia Minor, stretching on the coast from just west of Ayancık to just east of Hopa (most of this area is in modern Turkey). Greeks have been active in the area for a long time, with evidence of trading journeys taking place in the area around 1000 BCE. In the 8th century BCE, trading posts began to develop into permanent and increasingly prosperous settlements. The region briefly resisted Rome's hegemony in Asia Minor in the 1st century BCE. An independent Pontic kingdom with its capital at Amaseia (modern Amasya) was established at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. While superficially Hellenized, the kingdom retained its Persian social structure, with temple priests and feudal nobles ruling over a heterogeneous population. Pontus gradually asserted itself among the petty Hellenistic states of Asia Minor in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, annexing Sinope (modern Sinop) as its new capital (183 BCE). The Pontic kingdom reached its zenith under Mithradates VI Eupator (ca. 115-163 BCE), whose expansion programs brought about disastrous conflict with Rome, resulting in the incorporation of the kingdom into the Roman Empire (63-62 BCE). After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and of Trebizond (1461), many Pontian Greeks fled to Russia where they founded new villages and cities. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne brought about the expulsion of Christian Greeks living on Turkish territory. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Greeks living in Pontus in 1914, 300,000 were killed and the remainder became refugees. Despite this so-called "Catastrophe of Asia Minor," there are currently about 300,000 Muslim Grecophone Pontians on Turkey's Black Sea coast. Many Greek myths have connections to this region, including the trip of Jason and the Argonauts to find the Golden Fleece; the adventures of Ulysses in the land of the Cimmerians; and the sailing of Hercules on the Black Sea.]]></description>

The modern department (area 1,404 square miles) corresponds closely to the ancient province, which was bounded by Arcadia and Argolis on the north and Messenia in the west. Sparta, capital of the modern department, was also the capital of the ancient province.The coast, especially in the east, is rugged, with few good harbors. Mount Ilías (7,887 feet), the highest mountain of the Peloponnese, is here. Laconia remains more hospitable to grazing than agriculture. Neolithic sites (pre-2500 BCE) are found in the Evrótas valley, the Maléa peninsula, and elsewhere. Many settlements were founded in the Late Mycenaean period (1400-1100 BCE). According to Homer, Laconia was a strong kingdom ruled by Menelaus. The Dorian Invasion (ca. 1100 BCE) brought widespread destruction to the area. Coastal towns were freed by Rome in 195 BCE and they became members of the Achaean League, which eventually included all of Laconia. In 267 CE and again in 395 CE, Visigoths devastated the area, and there were Slavic incursions about 587 that led to two centuries of barbarism. Laconia became part of the Byzantine Empire in 805, and it was the site of struggles  between Slavs, Byzantines, Franks, Turks, and Venetians throughout the Middle Ages. Tradition holds that the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine Palaeologus, was crowned in the church of Hagios Demetrios, which still stands at Mistrás, southwest of Sparta. Inhabitants of the Máni peninsula played a prominent role in the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829). Archaeological work has been conducted in Sparta, Gythium, and Vapheio and a systematic survey of Laconia was begun in 1904 by the British School of Athens and continued intermittently. ]]></description>

It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

It was ruled by Romans by the 2nd century BCE, then was occupied successively by the Germanic Suebi, the Visigoths in the 5th century CE, and the Moors by 711. It became a separate kingdom in the 12th century, and began expanding globally with colonies in South America, Africa, and the Far East from the 14th to the 17th centuries. From 1580 to 1640 it was ruled by Spain. In 1640 the House of Bragança reestablished a native Portuguese kingdom that lasted until 1910, though it suffered much turbulence, especially during the period of the Napoleonic wars. A republic was established in 1910, since when the nation has undergone rule by various dictators. A constitution and free elections were established in 1976.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).]]></description>

The first reference to Media is found in the writings of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858-824 BCE), who referred to the country as Mada. The inhabitants gradually became known as Medes. According to Herodotus, Media and its capital Ecbatana (present day Hamadan) were founded by Deioces, son of Phraortes (ca. 715 BCE). Cyaxares, Deioces' grandson, led the revolt against the Assyrian empire, with Media expanding into Armenia, Îrān, and northern Assyria. In 550 BCE, Cyrus II (the Great) gained control over Media, making it part of the Achaemenian empire. Alexander the Great conquered Media, and divided it, giving the northern region to his general Atropates, who created the kingdom of Atropatene. Southern Media became part of the Seleucid empire. In ca. 152 BCE, Mithradates, the Parthian king, conquered southern Media and after a period of rule by the Arsacids, it, along with Atropatene, became part of the Sasanian empire. Effectively, Media was usurped into Persia. ]]></description>

The Assyrians were a Semitic people who spoke a dialect of Akkadian. Assyria was a dependency of Babylonia and later of the Mitanni kingdom during most of the 2nd millennium BCE. It became independent in the 14th century BCE and subsequently became a major power in Mesopotamia, Armenia, and sometimes in northern Syria. In the 9th century BCE the kingdom saw expansion and from the mid-8th to the late 7th century BCE, a series of strong Assyrian rulers united most of the Middle East, from Egypt to the Persian Gulf, under Assyrian rule. The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal. The empire was defeated by a Chaldean-Median coalition in 612-609 BCE. The Assyrians were noted for the fighting ability and cruelty. They were also monumental builders, as seen at the impressive sites of Nineveh, Ashur, and Nimrud.]]></description>

The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.]]></description>

According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166. The modern city is known worldwide for its technical and scientific educational institutions. The principal industries are metalworking and the production of vehicles. It is a transportation center with an airport and railway junction. Other notable economic activities are the sugar trade and the production and marketing of asparagus, sausage, and gingerbread. The 2004 estimated population was 245,600.  ]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. ]]></description>

                                         marck</a>"</h1>The nation of Denmark occupies the Jutland Peninsula, extending northwards from the center of western Europe, and some 400 islands to the east of it. It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.]]></description>

It was settled by Celts and became part of the Celtic kingdoms of Noricum, later incorporated into the Roman Empire ca. 15BCE and named Pannonia. Germanic people invaded it in the 5th century CE, followed by the Avars and Slovenes. Bavarians ruled it from ca. 780, and it became a frontier territory of the Frankish Empire. It became a duchy in 1180 and passed to the Babenberg dukes of Austria in 1192, then to the family of Hapsburg in 1276. After World War I part of its southern area was ceded to Yugoslavia. Since then, except for a brief period as a district under the German annexation, 1938-1945, it has been a federal province of Austria. ]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments.

Orléans was conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BCE; many Roman ruins have been found here. It was the most important city in France after Paris during the 10th and 11th centuries and it was the center of the royal duchy established by Philip VI in 1344. Orléans was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. The symbol of Saint James, the scalloped shell, became the primary symbol representing pilgrims. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Orléans is known as the city that was saved by the heroine Joan of Arc. An equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in the center of town and the large Gothic-style Cathedral of Sainte-Croix are historic landmarks.  Modern Orléans is a center for gardening and horticulture; it is particularly known for its roses. Other industries in Orléans include textiles, food processing, machinery manufacturing, and electrical engineering.]]></description>

The site of an ancient settlement, the Romans knew it as Leodium. It was established as a town and bishopric in 721. It became a noted center of learning and art in the Middle Ages. Strife between the guilds and the nobles dominated the early 14th century until political equality was granted to the laborers and to most of the trade guilds in 1313. The town was sacked by Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 15th century, but after his death was rebuilt and prospered. Both France and England attacked it during the War of Spanish Succession. The reign of the nobles ended in 1789, but then France took the town in 1795. After the creation of Belgium in 1830, the town flourished as an industrial center. The German army occupied it in both world wars, and it suffered heavy bombardment in the Second World War. Today it produces steel, coal, glass, copper, and armaments. It has many Romanesque and Gothic churches, and the former palace of the prince-bishops, now the Palais de Justice. It is the cultural center of Wallonie, with many museums and concert halls, an opera, theatre, the state university, the preserved house of the composer César Franck, and the Royal Conservatory of Music.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment.

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center.

By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

Siena was a Medieval seat of pro-imperial Ghibelline power and was an economic and territorial rival of Guelf (anti-imperial) Florence. The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

It was the site of Bronze Age and Roman settlements, was destroyed by the Alemanni in the 5th century, then rebuilt by the Franks. It was a leading medieval commercial and banking center; and was an important site in the development of Lutheranism in the 16th century. It declined in power during the Thirty Years War and passed to Bavaria in 1806. The artists Hans Holbein, the Elder and the Younger, and Hans Burgkmair were born in the town. Augsburg is the administrative capital of the Bavarian district of Swabia. It was the site of a firestorm caused by bombardment in World War II and was severely damaged, but much of its historic architecture survived to be restored. The city is rich in Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque buildings and fountains. It has a university founded in 1970, three colleges of music, and a technical college. In 1974, Augsburg annexed two neighboring cities, Göggingen and Haunstetten. It has grown to be a major site for heavy industry, chemicals, metal, and electrical plants. The 2004 estimated population was 260,600.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment.

The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry.

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

The region is composed of four broad belts of land stretching from north to south: in the west the high Pennine moorlands dissected by the Yorkshire Dales; in the southeast the central lowlands (including the Vale of York) draining into the River Humber estuary; in the east the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds; and, farther southeast, the Holderness plain along the North Sea. Yorkshire was bordered by the historic counties of Durham to the north, Westmorland to the northwest, Lancashire to the west, Cheshire and Derbyshire to the southwest, and Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the southeast. Yorkshire is now composed of all or most of the following administrative units: the county of North Yorkshire; the unitary authorities of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull, and York; the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees south of the River Tees; and all or most of every metropolitan borough in the metropolitan counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The exceptions are the parish of Finningley and the area west of Bawtry (both in the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire) which lie within the historic county of Nottinghamshire; the area around Beighton and Mosborough in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, which belongs to the historic county of Derbyshire; and the area west of Todmorden in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which lies within the historic county of Lancashire. The historic county also includes three large areas in other administrative units: much of the eastern part of the administrative county of Lancashire and much of the borough of Ribble Valley, including the entire Forest of Bowland region; Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh in the South Lakeland district of the administrative county of Cumbria; the area south of the Tees in the Teesdale district of the administrative county of Durham; and small areas along the southeast border of the historic county of Yorkshire lie in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. Yorkshire has a rich history: there are many prehistoric remains, including the impressive earthworks at Stanwick, and it was a Roman military stronghold from the 1st to the 5th century CE. After a time being controlled by indigenous Britons, Yorkshire became part of the kingdom of Deira from the 6th to the 9th century. It was taken by Danes 875 and recaptured by kings of Wessex 954. The region remained strongly Anglo-Scandinavian in culture until the Normans took control in 1069. Important monasteries were founded here and large artistocratic estates were established. After the Black Death of the 14th century, most of Yorkshire's crop land became pasture for sheep and woolen manufacture became an important industry. It was the base for Yorkists during War of the Roses (1455-1485) and two of the most important battles were fought here (Wakefield and Towton, 1460 and 1461). The battle at Marston Moor in 1644 was one of the most crucial of the English Civil Wars. Yorkshire's long history has left behind an outstanding array of architecture: pre-Norman churches; impressive ruined abbeys such as Rievaulx; castles such as Bolton; the outstanding Gothic York Minster; and notable country houses such as 18th-century Castle Howard.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).]]></description>

The site of an ancient settlement, the Romans knew it as Leodium. It was established as a town and bishopric in 721. It became a noted center of learning and art in the Middle Ages. Strife between the guilds and the nobles dominated the early 14th century until political equality was granted to the laborers and to most of the trade guilds in 1313. The town was sacked by Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 15th century, but after his death was rebuilt and prospered. Both France and England attacked it during the War of Spanish Succession. The reign of the nobles ended in 1789, but then France took the town in 1795. After the creation of Belgium in 1830, the town flourished as an industrial center. The German army occupied it in both world wars, and it suffered heavy bombardment in the Second World War. Today it produces steel, coal, glass, copper, and armaments. It has many Romanesque and Gothic churches, and the former palace of the prince-bishops, now the Palais de Justice. It is the cultural center of Wallonie, with many museums and concert halls, an opera, theatre, the state university, the preserved house of the composer César Franck, and the Royal Conservatory of Music. The 2003 estimated population was 185,700.]]></description>

Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770. The modern city boasts educational and scientific institutions, and healthy industries in bootbuilding, food processing, locomotive building, and textiles.

Orléans was conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BCE; many Roman ruins have been found here. It was the most important city in France after Paris during the 10th and 11th centuries and it was the center of the royal duchy established by Philip VI in 1344. Orléans was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, home of the shrine dedicated to Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. The symbol of Saint James, the scalloped shell, became the primary symbol representing pilgrims. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Orléans is known as the city that was saved by the heroine Joan of Arc. An equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in the center of town and the large Gothic-style Cathedral of Sainte-Croix are historic landmarks.  Modern Orléans is a center for gardening and horticulture; it is particularly known for its roses. Other industries in Orléans include textiles, food processing, machinery manufacturing, and electrical engineering.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

The chief cities were Tarentum (Taranto), Sybaris (Sibari), Crotona (Crotone), Heraclea, Cumae, Elea, and Neapolis (Naples).The people of this region were known to the Greeks as "Italiotai" and to the Romans as "Graeci." The cities were important centers of trade and commerce, and the colonies developed the famous Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy. Euboeans founded the first colonies, Pithecussae and Cumae, about 750 BC, and subsequently Spartans settled at Tarentum. Achaeans settled at Metapontum, Sybaris, and Croton, and Locrians colonized Locri Epizephyrii. The Chalcidians at settled at Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria). Several later Greek cities in Italy were descendants of these colonies. After the 5th century BCE, malaria, attacks by the neighboring Italic Lucanians and Bruttians, and interurban strife caused most of the cities to decline in importance. ]]></description>

Formerly, Vienna was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a Celtic settlement, it became a Roman military settlement and was occupied by the Magyars in 907, then passed to the Babenburgs in 976. It became the capital of the duchy of Austria in 1156 and was occupied by Ottocar II of Bohemia from 1251 to 1276. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Turks in 1529 and 1683. During the 18th century, Vienna was one of the great cultural centers in Europe, the home of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. The city was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1805 and 1808 and from 1814 to 1815. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and liberated by the Russians in 1945. The historic centre of Vienna was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.]]></description>

By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally a Celtic settlement, a Roman military camp was founded here by the Roman general Drusus 14-9 BCE. It became self-governing from 1118 to 1462, when a rebellion caused it to lose its free city privileges, and the leader of the league of Rhenish towns from 1254. It was a French possession from 1797 to 1815, and occupied by the French army from 1918 to 1930. It was almost totally destroyed in World War II, but has been rebuilt. Surviving historic architecture includes an 11th-century Romanesque cathedral, a 17th-century elector's palace, and a 19th-century German fortress built on the site of the old Roman military post. Mainz had a university from 1477 to 1816, but a new one, the Johannes Gutenberg University, it in 1946, honoring its native son who invented movable type here. The city is an educational center, with the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, the Institute for Economic Research, and the Academy of Sciences and Literature. There are many museums of art, history, and natural history, the Gutenberg Museum among them. The city's economic activities include the wine trade for the Rhineland, the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, machinery, glassware, and musical instruments. It is known for its wine and pre-Lenten festivals. The 2005 population was calculated at 187,940.]]></description>

The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century. The population estimate for 2004 was 969,500.]]></description>

It was the site of Bronze Age and Roman settlements, was destroyed by the Alemanni in the 5th century, then rebuilt by the Franks. It was a leading medieval commercial and banking center; and was an important site in the development of Lutheranism in the 16th century. It declined in power during the Thirty Years War and passed to Bavaria in 1806. The artists Hans Holbein, the Elder and the Younger, and Hans Burgkmair were born in the town. Augsburg is the administrative capital of the Bavarian district of Swabia. It was the site of a firestorm caused by bombardment in World War II and was severely damaged, but much of its historic architecture survived to be restored. The city is rich in Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque buildings and fountains. It has a university founded in 1970, three colleges of music, and a technical college. In 1974, Augsburg annexed two neighboring cities, Göggingen and Haunstetten. It has grown to be a major site for heavy industry, chemicals, metal, and electrical plants.

It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints.

The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy.

It lies astride the River Thames 50 miles (about 80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. It has burned and been rebuilt several times, notably in revolt of Queen Boudicca in 60 CE and in the Great Fire of 1666. It became a large trade center in the Middle Ages and expanded rapidly during the 16th and17th centuries and during the Industrial Revolution. During World War II the city was heavily bombed. London is not to be confused with Greater London which refers to all 32 London boroughs (Inner and Outer London boroughs) and the City of London; London is used to refer to the 12 Inner London boroughs and the City of London.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

It is first mentioned under the name Guting in 953. Receiving its charter in 1211, it became a powerful member of the Hanseatic League in the 14th century. It sustained severe damage during the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, but revived with the founding of the University of Göttingen, which soon became known of one of the best in Europe. The dismissal of seven professors (including J and K Grimm) in 1837 caused a sharp decline in its academic reputation and hence the prosperity of the city. Strong math and physics faculties eventually restored its good name in the late 19th century. The university's library has one of the finest collections in Europe and draws many visitors. Largely undamaged during World War II, the city retains much of its historic architecture, including whole streets of medieval half-timbered buildings, the city ramparts, and several Gothic churches. Its industries include tourism, the production of optical and precision instruments and printing. Its 2004 estimated population was 123,100.]]></description>

Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770. The modern city boasts educational and scientific institutions, and healthy industries in bootbuilding, food processing, locomotive building, and textiles.

Greeks have been active in the area for a long time, with evidence of trading journeys taking place in the area around 1000 BCE. In the 8th century BCE, trading posts began to develop into permanent and increasingly prosperous settlements. The region briefly resisted Rome's hegemony in Asia Minor in the 1st century BCE. An independent Pontic kingdom with its capital at Amaseia (modern Amasya) was established at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. While superficially Hellenized, the kingdom retained its Persian social structure, with temple priests and feudal nobles ruling over a heterogeneous population. Pontus gradually asserted itself among the petty Hellenistic states of Asia Minor in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, annexing Sinope (modern Sinop) as its new capital (183 BCE). The Pontic kingdom reached its zenith under Mithradates VI Eupator (ca. 115-163 BCE), whose expansion programs brought about disastrous conflict with Rome, resulting in the incorporation of the kingdom into the Roman Empire (63-62 BCE). After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and of Trebizond (1461), many Pontian Greeks fled to Russia where they founded new villages and cities. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne brought about the expulsion of Christian Greeks living on Turkish territory. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Greeks living in Pontus in 1914, 300,000 were killed and the remainder became refugees. Despite this so-called "Catastrophe of Asia Minor," there are currently about 300,000 Muslim Grecophone Pontians on Turkey's Black Sea coast. Many Greek myths have connections to this region, including the trip of Jason and the Argonauts to find the Golden Fleece; the adventures of Ulysses in the land of the Cimmerians; and the sailing of Hercules on the Black Sea.]]></description>

By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church. The calculated population for 2005 was 492,637.]]></description>

According to the poet Ferdowsi, Hamadān was built by King Jamshid. It was taken by Cyrus II the Great of Persia 550 BCE and became a Median capital. Alexander the Great in 330 BCE later captured the city. Hamadān was again captured, first by the Arabs in 641 or 642 CE, and then later by the Mongols around 1220 CE. In 1386, Timur, the Turkish conqueror destroyed the city and massacred its people. In the 17th century, the city was partially restored, and frequently changed hands between the Iranians and the Ottomans. Today the city is known for its medallion schemed rugs. Historic sites in the region include the Stone Lion (Parthian Monument), Avicenna Memorial Tomb (built in 1954, manuscript library, Qajar tomb), Ganjnameh Epigraphes (Darius's inscriptions on Alvand Mountain in Abbasabad valley), and the Alavid Dome (Islamic monument from Saljuk period). ]]></description>

Further Arab dynasties built palaces, gardens, mosques and fortified the city walls. Timur (Tamerlane), the Turkic conqueror, ruled the city in the late 14th century.

Although archeological findings indicate prehistoric settlements, inscriptions claim the city was built during the reign of Darius I (reg 522-486 BCE), who replaced Pasargadae with Persepolis as the capital. The city and castle of Xerxes I, Darius's son, (reg 485-465 BCE), was destroyed by Alexander the Great. In 316 BCE, Persepolis became the capital of Persis, a Macedonian empire, and then began to decline during the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE). By the 3rd century CE, the neaby city of Istakhr became the center of the Sasanian empire. Investigation of Persepolis' ruins began in 1618 by García Silva Figueroa, a Spanish ambassador to Persia who found references of the ancient city in the works by Quintus Curtius, Diodorus and Plutarch. In 1626, Englishman Thomas Herbert, published the first engraving of the ruins. Archaeological excavations at the site commenced in 1931 under Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt of the University of Chicago from 1931-1939, and through 1979 by Îrānian archaeologists.]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

Only a few ruins of the city remain today on the Cadmea, the acropolis of ancient Thebes. It was named for Cadmus, the mythical founder of the city. Thebes was the main city of ancient Boeotia, and is identified with many legends, including stories of Dirce, Epigonus, Oedipus and the Sphinx. It entered a power struggle with Athens in the 6th cen. BCE. It was destroyed by Alexander the Great.]]></description>

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

Under the early empire, Syria, which stretched northeast to the upper Euphrates and, until AD 73, included eastern Cilicia, became one of the most important provinces. Later Ituraea was incorporated and Judaea became its own province (later Syria Palaestina). Commagene was permanently annexed by Vespasian in 72 and the important caravan city of Palmyra came under Roman control, possibly during the reign of Tiberius. The province of Syria was itself divided into Syria Coele in the north and Syria Phoenice in the south. By the early 5th century it was subdivided into at least five provinces. The frontiers of the province were guarded by a fortified limes system.]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

Phoenicia was an important ancient country in ancient Syria, comprising several city-states by 1600 BCE. The Phoenicians were of Semitic origin (a branch of the Canaanites) and were famed as maritime traders. In 538 Phoenicia came under the rule of the Persians and it was later taken by Alexander the Great. The Roman Empire assumed direct rule in 64 BCE and Phoenicia was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria, though Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre retained self-government. The chief cities of Phoenicia (excluding colonies) were Sidon, Tyre, and Berot (modern Beirut).]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. ]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

Greeks have been active in the area for a long time, with evidence of trading journeys taking place in the area around 1000 BCE. In the 8th century BCE, trading posts began to develop into permanent and increasingly prosperous settlements. The region briefly resisted Rome's hegemony in Asia Minor in the 1st century BCE. An independent Pontic kingdom with its capital at Amaseia (modern Amasya) was established at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. While superficially Hellenized, the kingdom retained its Persian social structure, with temple priests and feudal nobles ruling over a heterogeneous population. Pontus gradually asserted itself among the petty Hellenistic states of Asia Minor in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, annexing Sinope (modern Sinop) as its new capital (183 BCE). The Pontic kingdom reached its zenith under Mithradates VI Eupator (ca. 115-163 BCE), whose expansion programs brought about disastrous conflict with Rome, resulting in the incorporation of the kingdom into the Roman Empire (63-62 BCE). After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and of Trebizond (1461), many Pontian Greeks fled to Russia where they founded new villages and cities. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne brought about the expulsion of Christian Greeks living on Turkish territory. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Greeks living in Pontus in 1914, 300,000 were killed and the remainder became refugees. Despite this so-called "Catastrophe of Asia Minor," there are currently about 300,000 Muslim Grecophone Pontians on Turkey's Black Sea coast. Many Greek myths have connections to this region, including the trip of Jason and the Argonauts to find the Golden Fleece; the adventures of Ulysses in the land of the Cimmerians; and the sailing of Hercules on the Black Sea.]]></description>

Under the early empire, Syria, which stretched northeast to the upper Euphrates and, until AD 73, included eastern Cilicia, became one of the most important provinces. Later Ituraea was incorporated and Judaea became its own province (later Syria Palaestina). Commagene was permanently annexed by Vespasian in 72 and the important caravan city of Palmyra came under Roman control, possibly during the reign of Tiberius. The province of Syria was itself divided into Syria Coele in the north and Syria Phoenice in the south. By the early 5th century it was subdivided into at least five provinces. The frontiers of the province were guarded by a fortified limes system.]]></description>

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.]]></description>

The Dacians had earlier occupied lands south of the Danube and north of the mountains, and the Roman province eventually included wider territories to the north and east. The Dacians spoke a Thracian dialect but were influenced culturally by the neighboring Scythians and by the Celtic invaders of the 4th century BCE. They worked in agriculture and in the local silver, gold, and iron mines. The Dacian Wars (85-89 CE) under the emperor Domitian resulted in Roman rule; hostilities resumed under Trajan. The provinces was divided under Hadrian into Dacia Superior and Dacia Inferior and was redivided in 159 by Antoninus Pius into the Tres Daciae (Dacia Porolissensis, Dacia Apulensis, and Dacia Malvensis). Marcus Aurelius made the provinces a single military region, ca. 168 CE. The border of the Roman territory might not have been clearly defined, but the empire benefitted both militarily and materially from the occupation.]]></description>

Founded by Slavs in 993, it received its first charter in 1317. It became an important medieval center, and flourished from the 17th century as a cultural and military center of Prussia. Under Frederick II the Great (1740-1786) is became the Prussian royal residence and practically the capital of Prussia. Many Dutch immigrants arrived in the18th century and created a distinctive Dutch quarter. The city was badly damaged in World War II, but much historic architecture has survived. Important historic structures include the Rococo Sans Souci Palace, 1745-47, the Nicolai Church, 1830-37, and the Brandenburg Gate, 1770. The modern city boasts educational and scientific institutions, and healthy industries in bootbuilding, food processing, locomotive building, and textiles.

It escaped capture by the Goths in the 5th century, and by the 12th century was a thriving center. It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).  Florence came under the ostensible (later actual) rule of the  Medici family from 1434.]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. ]]></description>

It rises in the west of Italy in the Cottian Alps, in the Monte Viso group. It empties into the Adriatic Sea. The river carries a very large sediment load, which expands the delta by around 200 acres per year. Ravenna and other ancient ports south of the delta are now miles from the sea as a result of silt from the Po carried down by currents in the Adriatic. The floods of the river and the silt load carried by it have long challenged hydraulic engineers; river regulation works originated in pre-Roman times, work was resumed in the Middle Ages, and the present arrangement existed by the end of the 15th century. Numerous projects have been undertaken in various areas of the river, including the Venetian Republic's having built dikes to control floods and canals to divert silt, and the Italian Land Reform's project to reclaim land in 1953.]]></description>

It was the capital of a Gaulish tribe; taken by Rome in 121 BCE, it became a chief city of Roman Gaul. It was plundered by Vandals and Visigoths in the 5th century. It was occupied by Saracens until 737, and then was under the counts of Toulouse in the 10th century. It  joined the French crown territories in 1229. It was a Protestant stronghold in the 16th century; it was the scene of an uprising in 1815. It is noted for well-preserved Roman buildings and artifacts.]]></description>

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The region is composed of four broad belts of land stretching from north to south: in the west the high Pennine moorlands dissected by the Yorkshire Dales; in the southeast the central lowlands (including the Vale of York) draining into the River Humber estuary; in the east the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds; and, farther southeast, the Holderness plain along the North Sea. Yorkshire was bordered by the historic counties of Durham to the north, Westmorland to the northwest, Lancashire to the west, Cheshire and Derbyshire to the southwest, and Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the southeast. Yorkshire is now composed of all or most of the following administrative units: the county of North Yorkshire; the unitary authorities of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull, and York; the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees south of the River Tees; and all or most of every metropolitan borough in the metropolitan counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The exceptions are the parish of Finningley and the area west of Bawtry (both in the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire) which lie within the historic county of Nottinghamshire; the area around Beighton and Mosborough in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, which belongs to the historic county of Derbyshire; and the area west of Todmorden in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which lies within the historic county of Lancashire. The historic county also includes three large areas in other administrative units: much of the eastern part of the administrative county of Lancashire and much of the borough of Ribble Valley, including the entire Forest of Bowland region; Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh in the South Lakeland district of the administrative county of Cumbria; the area south of the Tees in the Teesdale district of the administrative county of Durham; and small areas along the southeast border of the historic county of Yorkshire lie in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. Yorkshire has a rich history: there are many prehistoric remains, including the impressive earthworks at Stanwick, and it was a Roman military stronghold from the 1st to the 5th century CE. After a time being controlled by indigenous Britons, Yorkshire became part of the kingdom of Deira from the 6th to the 9th century. It was taken by Danes 875 and recaptured by kings of Wessex 954. The region remained strongly Anglo-Scandinavian in culture until the Normans took control in 1069. Important monasteries were founded here and large artistocratic estates were established. After the Black Death of the 14th century, most of Yorkshire's crop land became pasture for sheep and woolen manufacture became an important industry. It was the base for Yorkists during War of the Roses (1455-1485) and two of the most important battles were fought here (Wakefield and Towton, 1460 and 1461). The battle at Marston Moor in 1644 was one of the most crucial of the English Civil Wars. Yorkshire's long history has left behind an outstanding array of architecture: pre-Norman churches; impressive ruined abbeys such as Rievaulx; castles such as Bolton; the outstanding Gothic York Minster; and notable country houses such as 18th-century Castle Howard.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art.

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It was torn apart in Medieval times by the violent Guelph/Ghibelline rivalry: a series of wars was fought from the mid-13th century through the early 14th century between Guelf-controlled Florence and its allies (Montepulciano, Bologna, and Orvieto) and its Ghibelline opponents (Pisa, Siena, Pistoia, and Arezzo).

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

Phoenicia was an important ancient country in ancient Syria, comprising several city-states by 1600 BCE. The Phoenicians were of Semitic origin (a branch of the Canaanites) and were famed as maritime traders. In 538 Phoenicia came under the rule of the Persians and it was later taken by Alexander the Great. The Roman Empire assumed direct rule in 64 BCE and Phoenicia was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria, though Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre retained self-government. The chief cities of Phoenicia (excluding colonies) were Sidon, Tyre, and Berot (modern Beirut).]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The region is composed of four broad belts of land stretching from north to south: in the west the high Pennine moorlands dissected by the Yorkshire Dales; in the southeast the central lowlands (including the Vale of York) draining into the River Humber estuary; in the east the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds; and, farther southeast, the Holderness plain along the North Sea. Yorkshire was bordered by the historic counties of Durham to the north, Westmorland to the northwest, Lancashire to the west, Cheshire and Derbyshire to the southwest, and Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the southeast. Yorkshire is now composed of all or most of the following administrative units: the county of North Yorkshire; the unitary authorities of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull, and York; the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees south of the River Tees; and all or most of every metropolitan borough in the metropolitan counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The exceptions are the parish of Finningley and the area west of Bawtry (both in the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire) which lie within the historic county of Nottinghamshire; the area around Beighton and Mosborough in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, which belongs to the historic county of Derbyshire; and the area west of Todmorden in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which lies within the historic county of Lancashire. The historic county also includes three large areas in other administrative units: much of the eastern part of the administrative county of Lancashire and much of the borough of Ribble Valley, including the entire Forest of Bowland region; Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh in the South Lakeland district of the administrative county of Cumbria; the area south of the Tees in the Teesdale district of the administrative county of Durham; and small areas along the southeast border of the historic county of Yorkshire lie in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. Yorkshire has a rich history: there are many prehistoric remains, including the impressive earthworks at Stanwick, and it was a Roman military stronghold from the 1st to the 5th century CE. After a time being controlled by indigenous Britons, Yorkshire became part of the kingdom of Deira from the 6th to the 9th century. It was taken by Danes 875 and recaptured by kings of Wessex 954. The region remained strongly Anglo-Scandinavian in culture until the Normans took control in 1069. Important monasteries were founded here and large artistocratic estates were established. After the Black Death of the 14th century, most of Yorkshire's crop land became pasture for sheep and woolen manufacture became an important industry. It was the base for Yorkists during War of the Roses (1455-1485) and two of the most important battles were fought here (Wakefield and Towton, 1460 and 1461). The battle at Marston Moor in 1644 was one of the most crucial of the English Civil Wars. Yorkshire's long history has left behind an outstanding array of architecture: pre-Norman churches; impressive ruined abbeys such as Rievaulx; castles such as Bolton; the outstanding Gothic York Minster; and notable country houses such as 18th-century Castle Howard.]]></description>

It belonged to the Calenberg-Celle line of the House of Welf from 1495, from which George Louis became King George I of Britain in 1714. Hanover was the capitol of the kingdom of Hanover from 1815 to 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was rebuilt. Some of its historic structures were restored, including the old town hall, 1435-80, the opera house 1842-52, the Market Church, 1349-59, and the church of the Cross, 1333. Hanover has always been noted for its parks and public gardens, the most famous of which include the Great Garden, laid out in the 17th century, the Hanover woods, the Hermann-Löns Park, the Stadtpark, and the zoological gardens. Some ruins are left standing as memorials to the war dead. The city now functions as a center for communication and transportation (rail, air, and highway), finance, and industry. It is known as a manufacturing center for machinery and motor vehicles. From 1947 a German industrial fair, now names the Hanover Fair, has been held there, a fact that has greatly inspired its commercial development. The 2004 estimated population was 516,300.]]></description>

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.]]></description>

It flourished under the Lombard kings (6th century CE) and was a Medieval self-governing commune (constitution dates to 1179). Siena was a Medieval seat of pro-imperial Ghibelline power and was an economic and territorial rival of Guelf (anti-imperial) Florence. The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Originally two Wendish villages, Kölln and Berlin, were founded there in the 13th century, merged in the 14th century, and was named Berlin by the Hohenzollerns. It as strategically located at the center of the canal system of the Oder and Spree Rivers. As the capital of Nazi Germany, it was severely damaged in World War II, and following it, was divided into four occupation zones, each governed by one of the Allies. The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2004 estimated population was 3,396,300.]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. ]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman. The ancient land was commonly discussed as having two regions based on the color of the soil, Black Land (Kermit) and Red Land (Deshret).]]></description>

It reached its apex in the New Kingdom (ca. 1580-1080 BCE), when it was a storehouse for the wealth of defeated nations. Thebes spanned the Nile River about 400 miles south of modern Cairo. The east bank is the site of modern Luxor and El Karnak, and was formerly the city of the living, with great temples and residences. On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates. It was destroyed by the Romans in 29 BCE.  Today the area is an archaeological site.   ]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The original village grew up around a chapel on an island in the Zenne River. By the 6th century, it found itself located on an important trade route, and became a flourishing commercial center specializing in woolens in the medieval period. The merchant aristocracy was forced to share power with the craftsmen after their revolt in 1421. It was ruled successively by the Duke of Burgundy, then the Holy Roman Empire. It was part of the Spanish Netherlands from 1530, then of modern Belgium from 1830. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, it produced textiles, chemicals, electrical equipment, machinery, rubber goods and brewed beverages. It has become something of an international capital since it became the headquarters of the European Union.]]></description>

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917).

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. ]]></description>

It was inhabited in Paleolithic times and was the site of mining in the Bronze Age. It was settled by Celts and became part of the Celtic kingdoms of Noricum, later incorporated into the Roman Empire ca. 15BCE and named Pannonia. Germanic people invaded it in the 5th century CE, followed by the Avars and Slovenes. Bavarians ruled it from ca. 780, and it became a frontier territory of the Frankish Empire. It became a duchy in 1180 and passed to the Babenberg dukes of Austria in 1192, then to the family of Hapsburg in 1276. After World War I part of its southern area was ceded to Yugoslavia. Since then, except for a brief period as a district under the German annexation, 1938-1945, it has been a federal province of Austria. ]]></description>

Formerly, Vienna was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a Celtic settlement, it became a Roman military settlement and was occupied by the Magyars in 907, then passed to the Babenburgs in 976. It became the capital of the duchy of Austria in 1156 and was occupied by Ottocar II of Bohemia from 1251 to 1276. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Turks in 1529 and 1683. During the 18th century, Vienna was one of the great cultural centers in Europe, the home of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. The city was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1805 and 1808 and from 1814 to 1815. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and liberated by the Russians in 1945. The historic centre of Vienna was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.]]></description>

Founded around a castle in the mid-11th century, it was a thriving commercial link to Italy from the 12th century. It received its first charter in 1219 and quickly became a free imperial city. It flourished as a cultural center of northern Europe from the 15th century. The artist Albrecht Dürer was born there in 1471. It declined after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, and came under the rule of Bavaria in 1806. With the industrial revolution its fortunes revived. It was the focus of Hitler's political and industrial effort in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was heavily bombed by the Allies in World War II. The post-war trials of Nazi war criminals were held here. Much of its historic architecture was destroyed by the bombing, but some of its has been restored or rebuilt, notable the old imperial castle, the Renaissance town hall, the Gothic churches of St. Lorenz and St. Sebald, and the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost. Its major industries include the manufacture of mechanical and optical equipment, motor vehicles, textiles, and toys, for which it is a world center. It is a transportation center, with links by highway, canal, and air, and an educational center, with several institutions of higher learning, notably the Academy of Arts founded in 1662, and the Ohm Polytechnic Institute. Other institutes include the 600 year-old library and the Pegnesische Blumenorden, a literary society founded in 1644. The Germanisches Nationalmuseum houses a complete collection of Dürer prints. The 2004 estimated population was 495,600. ]]></description>

Under the early empire, Syria, which stretched northeast to the upper Euphrates and, until AD 73, included eastern Cilicia, became one of the most important provinces. Later Ituraea was incorporated and Judaea became its own province (later Syria Palaestina). Commagene was permanently annexed by Vespasian in 72 and the important caravan city of Palmyra came under Roman control, possibly during the reign of Tiberius. The province of Syria was itself divided into Syria Coele in the north and Syria Phoenice in the south. By the early 5th century it was subdivided into at least five provinces. The frontiers of the province were guarded by a fortified limes system.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

Originally founded as landing on the Zwijn estuary, it was named for a Roman bridge over the Reie River and known as a settlement since the seventh century. St. Eloi, bishop of Noyon-Tournai converted the town to Christianity, and the first counts of Flanders built a castle here in the9th century to guard against Norman invaders. It reached its height of commercial greatness in the 14th century, as one of the most important members of the Hanseatic League of trading cities. It remained rich an powerful as the site of the court of the dukes of Burgundy, rulers of Flanders, and the artistic center of the Flemish school of painting, until the religious and political turmoil of the 16th century brought about its decline. It revived with the construction ten miles away of the North Sea port of Zerbrugge and the opening in 1907 of a canal linking it to the port. It is famed for its medieval architecture and hanseatic buildings, and enjoys a thriving tourist industry in the 20th and 21st centuries. The 2003 population estimate was around 117,200.]]></description>

It is situated on the islands of Zealand and Amager on the Øresund sound. Its development began around the 10th century when a small fishing village was founded on the site of the modern city. In 1167 ramparts and a moat were built there, with a castle on a small islet off the coast. It became the capital of the kingdom of Denmark and the royal residence in 1445. During the strife of the Protestant Reformation the town was often sacked, was twice destroyed by the Hanseatic League. In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917). The 2004 population estimate was 619,900.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

It grew and developed in the 12th century under Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, and won its charter in 1247. It became a member of the Hanseatic League, passed into the possession of Hanover in 1705, then to Prussia in 1866. It suffered very little damage in World War II, and so much of its historic architecture survives. Among its structures are several brick buildings in northern German Gothic style, an entire square of Gothic and Renaissance houses called the Sand, the ducal palace, 1693-96, the town hall, 13th to 18th century, and the churches of St. Nicholas and St. John of the 13th and 14th centuries. Modern industries include wood products, the manufacture of chemicals and foodstuffs, and the mining of salt, metal, and coal. Having salt springs, it is also a spa and health resort. The 2004 estimated population was 69,000.]]></description>

Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166. The modern city is known worldwide for its technical and scientific educational institutions. The principal industries are metalworking and the production of vehicles. It is a transportation center with an airport and railway junction. Other notable economic activities are the sugar trade and the production and marketing of asparagus, sausage, and gingerbread. The 2004 estimated population was 245,600.  ]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It was founded as military colony by Roman proconsul Sextius Calvinus ca. 123 BCE. It was the site of defeat of Teutones by Marius in 102 BCE at the Battle of Aix. It was the main city of eastern Narbonensis in the 4th century CE. Aix-en-Provence was taken by Visigoths in 477, by Saracens in 731; it was also plundered by the Franks, Lombards, and finally Muslim invaders from Spain. Aix-en-Provence flourished in the Middle Ages as a center of learning and of the arts; its university, now the Universities of Aix-Marseille, was founded in 1409. It has been a part of France since 1487. It is an agricultural center and is espeically noted for its Provençal olives and almonds. Paul Cézanne's atelier is preserved as one of several city museums. The city serves mainly as a residential suburb of Marseille.]]></description>

The site of an ancient settlement, the Romans knew it as Leodium. It was established as a town and bishopric in 721. It became a noted center of learning and art in the Middle Ages. Strife between the guilds and the nobles dominated the early 14th century until political equality was granted to the laborers and to most of the trade guilds in 1313. The town was sacked by Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 15th century, but after his death was rebuilt and prospered. Both France and England attacked it during the War of Spanish Succession. The reign of the nobles ended in 1789, but then France took the town in 1795. After the creation of Belgium in 1830, the town flourished as an industrial center. The German army occupied it in both world wars, and it suffered heavy bombardment in the Second World War. Today it produces steel, coal, glass, copper, and armaments. It has many Romanesque and Gothic churches, and the former palace of the prince-bishops, now the Palais de Justice. It is the cultural center of Wallonie, with many museums and concert halls, an opera, theatre, the state university, the preserved house of the composer César Franck, and the Royal Conservatory of Music. The 2003 estimated population was 185,700.]]></description>

Formerly, Vienna was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a Celtic settlement, it became a Roman military settlement and was occupied by the Magyars in 907, then passed to the Babenburgs in 976. It became the capital of the duchy of Austria in 1156 and was occupied by Ottocar II of Bohemia from 1251 to 1276. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Turks in 1529 and 1683. During the 18th century, Vienna was one of the great cultural centers in Europe, the home of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. The city was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1805 and 1808 and from 1814 to 1815. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and liberated by the Russians in 1945.

By the 11th century it had developed as a fortified settlement at the intersection of major European trade routes. It was first mentioned in 1015 under the name Urbs Libzi, and was granted town status by 1170. It quickly became a commercial center, and the agriculture of the fertile Leipzig basin made it a notable market town. Famed for printing since 1470, by 1700 it was the most important German center of commerce, and did a busy trade in books, textiles, and furs. In 1839 the first German railway was built between Dresden and Leipzig, promoting the growth of industries such as metallugy. Leipzig also became a cultural center, famed as the home of J.S. Bach who, in his later years, was the city's director of church music. It was heavily damaged in World War II, and was extensively rebuilt. New post-war industries include the manufactures of machine tools, garments, and electronics. The great Leipzig Fair held every spring is the major market for trade between eastern and western Europe. The city remains a cultural leader with the University of Leipzig founded in 1409, academies of music, bookmaking, and drama, an orchestra, and an opera house. Surviving and restored historic architecture includes the Old Town Hall, the Old Commercial Exchange, and the 13th-century St. Thomas' church.

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

First mentioned as a village in 764, it was expanded and fortified by the Elector Frederick IV in 1606. It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor. The 2004 population estimate was 309,600.]]></description>

The original Slav village of Drezdzen was settled on the north bank of the Elbe, and a German town was founded on the south bank in the early 13th century. The city was variously held by Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Meissen in the 14th century, then went to Saxony in 1489. It was leveled by fire in 1491, and was damaged in wars in 1756 and 1813, and notably in World War II when it was almost totally destroyed by bombing. In the 19th century Dresden grew and prospered, thanks to its railway connections to Leipzig and Berlin and the development of industries in its outlying areas. Before World War II it had hundreds of fine Baroque and Rococo buildings. After the war, restoration began around the Rococo museum the Zwinger , and the area outside was rebuilt along modern lines. The ruins of the Frauenkirche built 1726-1743 were left as a war memorial. Dresden is a cultural center with many museums and art galleries, a celebrated opera house, symphony orchestra, and state theater. It has many educational institutions including colleges of music, art, teaching, and medicine. There are also institutes for science and research. Local industry specializes in the manufacture of high-end products such as optical and precision instruments. It is a transportation hub with an airport, extensive rail connections, and connections via the Elbe river to distant places. The calculated population for 2005 was 480,801.]]></description>

Teutons, Celts, Slavs, and Balts inhabited it by the first century BCE. Part of the area was ruled by Romans, then Carolingians. Through the centuries, it was often broken into various states based on ethnic groups including the Alemanni, Bavarians, Upper and Lower Franks, Thuringians, and Frisians. It undertook expansion during the 19th to mid-20th centuries. The official language is German, although Low German is still spoken in the rural North.

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland. The 2004 estimated population was 5,405,600.]]></description>

Agricultural settlements arose in the 7th millennium BCE. Advanced civilizations developed here in the Mediterranean area with Asian and African influences. Modern European nations began to form after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed the formation and expansion of the European Union, a group of European nations allied for trade and some administrative purposes, such as a common currency. ]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored.

In the 1950s three East German Bezirke, or national districts, were formed of the historic Saxon region. After the reunification of Germany, all or parts of these three districts were made into the German state of Saxony. It measures some 7080 square miles in area and has a population of about 4, 278,000. Its capital is Dresden. Except for the northern portion around Leipzig, which belongs to the North European Plain, the state is mostly mountainous in terrain. It is drained by the Elbe river, which runs northwest to southeast, and the Mulde, a tributary of the Elbe. Saxony's principal mountain range is the Ore Mountains, which run for about 100 miles along its southern border. The state has rich soil and its agriculture is highly developed, grains being important throughout most of the state, while cattle are the main product in the Ore Mountains. Forestry and the mining of tin, lead, and coal are also important. The main industries are the production of textiles and of machinery used in textile production, papermaking, printing, and mining. ]]></description>

The island was colonized by Greece from the 8th century BCE and by the Romans by 215 BCE. It was later taken by Vandals, Goths (493 CE), Byzantines and Arabs (850) and it thrived under the Normans (from the 11th century) and the Hohenstaufens. The island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and it was ruled by the Bourbons in the 18th century. Sicily became a major center of revolutionary movements in the 19th century: as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons in 1860 and in the following year it was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. Sicily gained regional autonomy in 1947.]]></description>

The settlement began as an Early Bronze Age citadel in the 3rd mill. BCE. Excavations reveal that several battles took place here, one apparently destroying the city ca. 1180 BCE, perhaps forming part of the cultural memory that was set down in the Iliad ca. 700 BCE. Shortly after the event of 1180 BCE, it was probably resettled by a population from the eastern Balkans. Greeks began moving into the area around Troy ca. 700 BCE. It was later ruled successively by Persia, Alexander the Great, Seleucid dynasty, Pergamum kingdom and Rome. It was finally a Byzantine settlement, and ultimately abandoned ca. 1350 CE.]]></description>

It flourished under the Lombard kings (6th century CE) and was a Medieval self-governing commune (constitution dates to 1179). Siena was a Medieval seat of pro-imperial Ghibelline power and was an economic and territorial rival of Guelf (anti-imperial) Florence. The population was ravaged by the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348. Siena was ruled by Charles of Anjou in the 13th century, the Visconti of Milan in the early 15th century, and the Medici of Florence after 1557.]]></description>

Mentioned in 913 as Chassala, the town was probably the seat of Franconian kings. Ruled by Hesse from the 13th century, it became the residence of the Hessian landgraves around 1277. The town expanded in size and population when the New Town was built in the 14th century, then the Upper New Town in the 17th century to accommodate Huguenot refugees. It served as the capital of the Electorate of Hessen from 1567 to 1866. It became in the early 20th century a producer of aircraft and tanks, and as such was heavily bombed in World War II.  It historic architecture includes the Orangery Palace, 1701-11, and the Ottoneum, 1604-07, rebuilt in 1697, and claimed to be the oldest theatre building in Germany, being now a museum. Kassel has a large number of museums, including the intriguing German Wallpaper Museum. The city has several technical schools and an academy of applied art. A famous statue of Hercules, situated at the very top of the series of cascades, has been the city's symbol over the last 250 years. Today it is important as a railway junction and transportation center, and local industries include the manufacture of optical and precision instruments, textiles, and transportation equipment. Its 2004 estimated population was 193,900.]]></description>

With Mesopotamia, it was one of the earliest literate, urban societies. It provided a critical influence on ancient Israel, ancient Greece, and other cultures, which in turn influenced civilizations of the modern Western world. Egypt was the earliest advanced civilization in Africa and probably influenced the development of other African cultures. Egypt was home to Neolithic cultures by 6000 BCE; Thinite dynasty united Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3100 BCE; on the path of Alexander the Great; Ptolemaic kingdom by 240 BCE; was an important Hellenistic center; then part of the Roman Empire until the Arab conquest in 640, then it was Mameluk and Ottoman.

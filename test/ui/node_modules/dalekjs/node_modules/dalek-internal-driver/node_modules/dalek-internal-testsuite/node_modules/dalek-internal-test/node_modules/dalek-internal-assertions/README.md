## Docs

This module is used internally by [DalekJS](//github.com/dalekjs/dalek).
I can not think of a situation where this module is helpful in other ways then
beeing pulled down & loaded by Dalek. But hey, surprise me.

For Dalek, this is the module that defines all the methods that can check a behaviour
of the browser, or some element contents. The methods are be part of the test object that dalek injects into the user tests.

If you wonder what assertions are:
> Assertions check if the assumptions you made about a website are correct. Assetions might check ig the title of a page is as expected, if an element has the expected text, if your mobile website version only displays a certian amount of elements and many more...

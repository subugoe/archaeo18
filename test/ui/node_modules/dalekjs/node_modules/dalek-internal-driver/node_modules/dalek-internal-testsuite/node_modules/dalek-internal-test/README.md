## Help Is Just A Click Away

### #dalekjs on FreeNode.net IRC

Join the `#daleksjs` channel on [FreeNode.net](http://freenode.net) to ask questions and get help.

### [Google Group Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dalekjs)

Get announcements for new releases, share your projects and ideas that are
using DalekJS, and join in open-ended discussion that does not fit in
to the Github issues list or StackOverflow Q&A.

**For help with syntax, specific questions on how to implement a feature
using DalekJS, and other Q&A items, use StackOverflow.**

### [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dalekjs)

Ask questions about using DalekJS in specific scenarios, with
specific features. For example, help with syntax, understanding how a feature works and
how to override that feature, browser specific problems and so on.

Questions on StackOverflow often turn in to blog posts or issues.

### [Github Issues](//github.com/dalekjs/dalek-internal-test/issues)

Report issues with DalekJS, submit pull requests to fix problems, or to
create summarized and documented feature requests (preferably with pull
requests that implement the feature).

**Please don't ask questions or seek help in the issues list.** There are
other, better channels for seeking assistance, like StackOverflow and the
Google Groups mailing list.

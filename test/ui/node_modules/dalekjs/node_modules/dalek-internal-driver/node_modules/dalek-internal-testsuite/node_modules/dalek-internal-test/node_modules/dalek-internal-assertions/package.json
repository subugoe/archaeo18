But hey, surprise me.\n\nFor Dalek, this is the module that defines all the methods that can check a behaviour\nof the browser, or some element contents. The methods are be part of the test object that dalek injects into the user tests.\n\nIf you wonder what assertions are:\n> Assertions check if the assumptions you made about a website are correct. Assetions might check ig the title of a page is as expected, if an element has the expected text, if your mobile website version only displays a certian amount of elements and many more...\n\n## Help Is Just A Click Away\n\n### #dalekjs on FreeNode.net IRC\n\nJoin the `#daleksjs` channel on [FreeNode.net](http://freenode.net) to ask questions and get help.\n\n### [Google Group Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dalekjs)\n\nGet announcements for new releases, share your projects and ideas that are\nusing DalekJS, and join in open-ended discussion that does not fit in\nto the Github issues list or StackOverflow Q&A.\n\n**For help with syntax, specific questions on how to implement a feature\nusing DalekJS, and other Q&A items, use StackOverflow.**\n\n### [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dalekjs)\n\nAsk questions about using DalekJS in specific scenarios, with\nspecific features.
